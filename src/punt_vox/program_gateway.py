"""The daemon-facing seam every client surface calls -- ``ProgramGateway``.

The surfaces (the ``mic`` MCP tools and the ``vox music`` CLI) are thin adapters
over this one Protocol: they translate MCP/CLI semantics into gateway calls and
render what comes back, holding no daemon logic themselves. Production backs it
with :class:`~punt_vox.client_gateway.ClientProgramGateway` (WebSocket to
``voxd``); tests inject an in-memory fake. No method takes a session or an owner
-- ``voxd`` state is machine-universal, so any client drives any command and
every client can read the authoritative status (design section 4).
