"""The single logging owner: one append handler over one vox.log for every process.

The daemon and every client (MCP server, hook, CLI, detached playback) install
the same :class:`AppendLogHandler` pointed at one ``vox.log``. Each process writes
its own records there by a local ``O_APPEND`` append -- no ship transport, no
fallback file, no daemon round-trip on a hook's logging hot path (DES-017). A
client stamps ``client.<role>.`` onto its logger name so its lines grep apart from
the daemon's; the multi-writer-safe :class:`AtomicAppendLog` behind the handler
owns rotation and 0600, so the two configs can never drift into two rotation
mechanisms racing on the file.

Both entry points first tighten ``~/.punt-labs/vox`` and ``…/logs`` to 0700 via
:class:`PrivateState`, so a client that never ran ``ensure_user_dirs`` still
re-tightens a pre-existing loose directory. Client tightening is best-effort
(never crash a hook); the daemon additionally fail-closes in ``main`` before this.

The active level follows the ``log_level`` config key (default INFO): a client
re-reads it each run, so ``/vox log debug`` applies immediately; the daemon reads
it at startup, so a running daemon picks up a change on ``vox daemon restart``.
