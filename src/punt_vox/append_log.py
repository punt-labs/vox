"""A multi-writer-safe append-only log sink: atomic ``O_APPEND``, 0600, rotation.

Generalizes the ``vibe_trace`` line-writer. Every :meth:`AtomicAppendLog.append`
escapes its text to exactly one physical line and writes it in a *single*
``os.write`` under ``O_APPEND``. POSIX guarantees an ``O_APPEND`` write seeks to
end and appends atomically, and a log line is far shorter than the platform's
atomic-append size, so lines from concurrent processes never interleave -- no
lock, no long-lived shared handle. Many writers therefore share one file safely.

The error path must never re-enter the logging subsystem: many concurrent
processes append here through ``logging``, so calling ``logger.*`` on an
``OSError`` would recurse straight back into this sink. On failure it writes a
best-effort note to ``sys.__stderr__`` and returns.

Rotation is safe under concurrent writers, guarded by an ``flock`` protocol on a
stable ``<path>.rotate.lock`` file (never itself renamed, so the lock identity
survives the rename chain). Every append holds ``LOCK_SH`` across
``open -> write -> close``; a rotation takes ``LOCK_EX`` -- which ``flock`` grants
only once every shared holder has drained -- and re-checks the size before
renaming. So no rename runs while any writer has an open append fd (no write to a
renamed file), and at most one rotator renames per threshold crossing (no double
rotate). This realizes the state model in ``docs/vox-2594-log-rotation.tex``.
