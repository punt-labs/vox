"""Bind one fill outcome to the Program it was generated for -- the apply-time guard.

A generation that has already settled and posted its outcome can be overtaken in
the single control queue by a :class:`SwitchProgram`: the consumer applies the
switch first (retargeting the channel to a different Program), then applies the
now-stale outcome to *that* Program -- so a switched-in pool gains a Part it never
generated, or a retune inherits the abandoned pool's failure. The single-flight
cancel/discard in :class:`Filler` covers only an *in-flight* generation; it cannot
touch one that finished and enqueued its outcome before the switch drained.

``FreshFillOutcome`` closes that gap. Each posted outcome is tagged with the
Program it was generated under, and the guard drops it at apply time if the
control writer has since retargeted to another Program. Because every switch
installs a *fresh* Program instance (and cancels the prior fill), identity is an
exact tag: the outcome applies iff the writer still animates the very Program the
generation ran for.
