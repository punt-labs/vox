"""The ``SwitchSelection`` control signal -- retarget to a consume-only replay.

Playing a Selection (a name, a ``(style, vibe)`` pair, or a style/vibe union)
replaces *which* source the daemon animates with a :class:`SelectionPlayback`.
Like :class:`SwitchProgram`, the swap is a :class:`ControlSignal` posted to the
single :class:`ControlChannel` writer, so it is serialised with every other
mutation. It arms no fill: a Selection is consume-only,
so ``wants_generation`` is false and the reconcile that follows idles the fill.
The seeded :class:`SelectionPlayback` already begins at its first track.
