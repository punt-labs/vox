"""The format-neutral sub-views of a Program's runtime status (design section 5).

Three small value objects project the parts of a :class:`ProgramState` a client
watches -- what is playing, how generation is faring, and which Parts failed
permanently. Every field is format-agnostic: "Part N of M" reads the same for a
playlist track, a podcast segment, or an audiobook chapter, so Phases 2--3
populate the identical shape with no field change. Each round-trips through JSON
so the value crosses the ``voxd`` wire to any client (PY-EH-8 on deserialize).
