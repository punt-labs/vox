"""The playback loop -- play the current Part, auto-advance, race controls.

``ProgramLoop`` owns the player and nothing else: it plays ``program.playing``,
and when the track ends it *posts a Rotate message* (never mutating the Program
directly) so the single :class:`ControlChannel` writer advances the cursor, then
plays the new ``program.playing``. It never generates. A skip / play-a-part /
off interrupts the current track at once (the channel's ``interrupt`` event); a
retune does not -- the current track finishes first, then the loop plays the new
pool's Part (finish-current-then-switch). This closes the bas7 gap: the advance
is a real, listened-to transition, proven by a test that asserts the loop
spawned a *different* file on track-end.

The interrupt-vs-natural-end race lives in :class:`InterruptRace`; a player
*spawn* failure (a missing ``afplay``/``ffplay`` binary, or an OS resource limit)
is handled here: it is not a Program transition -- the Part stays ready and the
cursor unmoved -- so it is recorded on the shared :class:`PlaybackHealth` (which
status surfaces, never only a log) and followed by a bounded backoff so a
persistent failure cannot spin the loop hot.
