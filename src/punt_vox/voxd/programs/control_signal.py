"""The ``ControlSignal`` command interface -- one serialized source mutation.

Every mutation of the active playback source -- a user command (turn on, rotate,
retune, off), an automatic advance, a switch to a replay Selection, or a fill
outcome from the :class:`Filler` -- is a ``ControlSignal`` posted to the
single-consumer :class:`ControlChannel`. The consumer applies signals one at a
time, so the Z sequential semantics are real: no two commands ever interleave
against a stale source. Each signal is a typed command that knows its own
transition (Command pattern, PY-DP-11). A generate-family signal narrows
``isinstance(source, Program)`` and rejects as a lost race when the active source
is a consume-only :class:`SelectionPlayback` (finding #4).
