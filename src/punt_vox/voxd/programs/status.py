"""``ProgramStatus`` -- the first-class, format-spanning observability surface.

Because any client now drives ``voxd`` (ownership is gone), any client must be
able to *see* what ``voxd`` is doing. ``ProgramStatus`` is that view: a single,
format-neutral value object rendered identically through the ``mic`` MCP
``status`` tool and the ``vox music status`` CLI. It carries no ``vibe``/``style``
content (that is manifest *subject* data, not runtime status), so the same shape
reports a playlist track today and a podcast segment or audiobook chapter later
with no field change -- the shape is decided here, once (design section 5).

Both failure surfaces are present and distinct:
``generation.last_error`` is the *program-level* failure (retrying/failed,
nothing can play) and ``failed_parts`` is the *per-Part* permanent failure while
the Program plays on. Reading a log is not a strategy for a client: a caller
asking "what is playing?" gets exactly this, authoritatively, on every call.
