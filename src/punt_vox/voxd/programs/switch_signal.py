"""The ``SwitchProgram`` control signal -- swap the animated Program atomically.

Turning a Program on or playing a saved one replaces *which* Program the daemon
animates. Doing that swap in the handler thread is the vox-73m5 lost-update: a
second client's command could interleave against a half-swapped state. So the
switch is a :class:`ControlSignal` posted to the single :class:`ControlChannel`
writer, which applies it atomically -- retarget the channel to the freshly seeded
Program, point the shared :class:`ActiveContext` at its backing store/directory,
then drive the one transition (``turn_on`` to generate, ``start_from_disk`` to
replay). The prior Program is discarded and its playback stopped (``interrupts``);
the reconcile that follows starts or cancels the fill for the new Program.
