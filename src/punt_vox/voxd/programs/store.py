"""The persistence seam: the ``ProgramStore`` and ``PartStore`` protocols.

All Program and Part persistence lives behind these two protocols (PY-IC-9,
PY-DP-11). The domain and the fill loop depend only on these interfaces, never
on ``pathlib`` or ``json`` directly, so every domain and loop test runs
filesystem-free against an in-memory fake. The production implementations live
in :mod:`punt_vox.voxd.programs.filesystem_store`.
