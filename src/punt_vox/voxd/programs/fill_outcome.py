"""The shared spine of the recovering fill outcomes (Produced, PermanentFailure).

A produced Part and a permanent per-Part failure apply the same way: if the
Program is retrying, ``recover`` first, then dispatch the mode-appropriate
transition for ``generating_first`` or ``playing_filling`` and drop the outcome
in any other mode. ``RecoveringFillOutcome`` owns that spine (and the shared
``interrupts = False``) as a template method; each concrete outcome supplies
only its two mode hooks. A transient outcome drives the retry machine instead,
so it is *not* one of these -- it lives in ``fill_signal`` on its own.
