"""The single-writer control channel -- the one place the active source is mutated.

``ControlChannel`` is a single-consumer command queue. Every mutation of the
active playback source -- user commands, automatic advances, source switches, and
fill outcomes -- is posted as a :class:`ControlSignal` and drained one at a time
by exactly one consumer task that applies it to the current source. This realises
the O2 concurrency contract: the Z state machine is sequential, so two clients
firing ``next`` and ``vibe`` at once (or a fill completing mid-command) can never
interleave or apply against a stale base. A command whose precondition no longer
holds -- a lost race, e.g. a fill outcome that arrives just after a switch to a
replay Selection -- raises a :class:`GuardViolationError`; the consumer logs it at
INFO and moves on rather than dying, so one losing racer cannot take down the
sole writer.

A *non-guard* failure is a different animal: a plain ``ValueError`` from a
corrupt successor state, or any other unexpected exception, means a bug -- not a
race. The consumer never swallows it as a lost race; it surfaces at ERROR
through the ``serve`` guard, always sets ``changed`` first so the
playback loop never blocks forever on a half-applied command, and keeps the sole
writer alive.
