"""Play WebSocket handler: play a stored recording on the daemon host.

``vox play <id>`` routes here so audio comes out on the machine with speakers
(the daemon host), not on a remote client. The reference is a bare store name,
resolved and containment-checked exactly like a record name -- an absolute,
traversing, or separated ref is refused before any file is touched, and only a
file that exists inside the daemon-owned store is played. Playback runs through
the shared serialized :class:`PlaybackQueue`, so no audio is killed and the
flock ordering holds.
