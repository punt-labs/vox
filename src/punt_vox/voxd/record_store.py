"""Daemon-owned recording store: the one place a record write can land.

A wire client never names a daemon path. It supplies at most a **bare name**
(or nothing, in which case the store content-addresses by text); the store
rejects anything absolute, separated, traversing, empty, or NUL-bearing, then
resolves the candidate under a daemon-owned root and **verifies containment**
before writing. This is the vox-zu39 (P1) security primitive: the token
authorizes audio operations, not filesystem writes as the daemon user, so no
request -- local or remote -- can escape the root.

The write itself is atomic: a fresh source is moved with an atomic rename (copy
fallback only on cross-filesystem ``EXDEV``); a cached source is copied through
the descriptor ``mkstemp`` returned (0600, ``O_EXCL``) then renamed onto the
destination with ``os.replace``, so a crash mid-write leaves no partial file
and a world-writable race cannot swap a symlink under the write.
