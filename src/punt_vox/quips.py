"""Centralized quip registry for hook speech phrases.

Each pool is a tuple of strings — immutable, deterministic ordering for
testing.  ``random.choice()`` picks from them at runtime.

Pools are grouped by hook event.  Keeping all text here simplifies
future localization (swap this module) and theming (load from config).
