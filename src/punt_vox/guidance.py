"""Install vox's usage guide and register it as a global CLAUDE.md import.

:class:`VoxGuidance` owns the vox-side artifact: it writes the usage guide to
``~/.punt-labs/vox/CLAUDE.md`` and registers the line
``@~/.punt-labs/vox/CLAUDE.md`` in the user's ``~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`` via
:class:`~punt_vox.claude_md.GlobalClaudeImports`, so the guide loads in every
Claude Code session without a per-project edit. The installer rewrites the
guide every run, so it is the single source of truth and can never drift from
the running vox version; uninstall deletes the guide and prunes its import.
