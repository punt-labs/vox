    atomically: a temp file in the target's own directory is flushed,
    ``fsync``-ed, and ``os.replace``-d over the target, so an interrupted write
    (SIGKILL, power loss) leaves the original untouched rather than truncated. A
    symlinked path is followed to its real file so the rename updates the file
    rather than clobbering the link. The replacement's mode defaults to the
    target's current mode (a brand-new file gets :data:`_NEW_FILE_MODE`), or a
