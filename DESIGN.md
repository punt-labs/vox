## State Management

Per-project config lives in `.punt-labs/vox/` as two files:

```text
.punt-labs/vox/vox.md          # tracked in git — durable preferences
---
voice: ""
provider: ""
model: ""
notify: "n"
speak: "y"
---

.punt-labs/vox/vox.local.md    # gitignored — ephemeral session state
---
vibe: ""
vibe_mode: "auto"
vibe_tags: ""
vibe_nudge_turns: "0"
---
```

Durable keys (voice, provider, model, notify, speak) route to `vox.md`. Ephemeral keys (vibe, vibe_mode, vibe_tags, vibe_nudge_turns) route to `vox.local.md`. All hooks and commands read these files for current state. See DES-012 for why this is per-project, not global, and DES-036 for the two-file split.

## DES-001: Notification Architecture — Stop Hook with Decision Block

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How task-completion notifications work

### Design

The Stop hook uses `decision: "block"` to make Claude generate one more turn with a spoken summary. This is the only mechanism available — the Stop hook does not support `additionalContext`.

**Flow:**

```text
Claude finishes → Stop hook fires → reads tts.local.md
  ├── notify=n → exit 0 (let stop, no notification)
  ├── stop_hook_active=true → exit 0 (prevent infinite loop)
  └── notify=y|c → return { decision: "block", reason: "..." }
        → Claude generates 1-2 sentence summary
        → Claude calls TTS speak tool (ephemeral, auto_play)
        → Claude stops → Stop hook fires again
        → stop_hook_active=true → exit 0 (done)
```

**The `reason` field is the prompt.** It tells Claude:

- Summarize what you just did in 1-2 sentences
- Call the TTS speak tool with ephemeral=true, auto_play=true
- Do not add any other commentary

### Why This Design

- The model understands what it just did and can generate intelligent summaries
- `last_assistant_message` is available but would require external summarization (API call) or dumb truncation if processed in shell only
- `stop_hook_active` provides a built-in infinite loop guard
- The extra model turn is minimal (1-2 sentences + tool call)

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Shell-only: extract + truncate `last_assistant_message`, call `tts synthesize` CLI | No intelligent summarization; shell truncation produces poor summaries |
| Async hook with CLI call | Cannot block the stop to get a summary; would only produce "task complete" with no context |
| `additionalContext` in Stop hook | Not supported — Stop hook only has `decision`/`reason` for control |

### UX Concern: Extra Model Turn

The user sees Claude generate one more message (the summary). This is acceptable because:

1. The summary is brief (1-2 sentences)
2. The audio plays while the user reads, not instead of reading
3. The skill prompt instructs minimal output

If this proves annoying, the fallback is Approach B: async shell-only with `tts synthesize "Task complete"` (no summary, just a notification).

---

## DES-002: Permission-Prompt Notification — Async CLI Call

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How permission-prompt notifications work

### Design

The Notification hook (matcher: `permission_prompt`) fires an async shell command that calls the `tts` CLI directly. No model involvement.

**Flow:**

```text
Permission dialog appears → Notification hook fires (async)
  → reads tts.local.md
  ├── notify=n → exit 0
  ├── speak=n → play chime audio file
  └── speak=y → pick random phrase → vox synthesize "$TEXT" -o $TMPDIR/notify.mp3
```

### Why Async + CLI (Not Model)

- The notification message is already clear ("Claude needs permission to use Bash")
- No summarization needed — just announce it
- Async avoids blocking the permission dialog
- CLI call is fast and self-contained

### Why Not MCP Tool

The Notification hook runs outside the model's conversation. It cannot call MCP tools (those require the model to invoke them). The CLI is the correct interface for hook-initiated synthesis.

---

## DES-003: State File — Extended Config

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SUPERSEDED by DES-012, then DES-036
**Topic:** Where notification and speech state is persisted

### Original Design (Superseded)

Originally used `~/.claude/tts.local.md` (global). Moved to `.vox/config.md` (per-project) in DES-012. Then split into `.punt-labs/vox/vox.md` + `vox.local.md` in DES-036 (v4.7.5). See the State Management section at the top for current layout.

---

## DES-004: /speak Toggle — Voice vs. Chime

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How `/speak y` and `/speak n` control notification audio

### Design

`/speak y` = spoken words via TTS provider. `/speak n` = short audio tone (chime).

Chime audio is a pre-generated MP3 file bundled in the package. Two distinct tones:

- `chime_done.mp3` — task completed (pleasant, resolving)
- `chime_prompt.mp3` — needs approval (attention-getting, rising)

Played via `afplay` (macOS) directly from the hook script.

### Why Pre-Generated

- No API call needed for chimes — instant playback
- No provider dependency for chime-only mode
- Consistent sound regardless of provider availability

---

## DES-005: /recap — On-Demand Spoken Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How `/recap` generates and speaks a summary

### Design

`/recap` is a slash command (skill prompt) that instructs the model to:

1. Summarize the key points of its last response in 2-3 sentences
2. Call the TTS speak tool with the summary (ephemeral, auto_play)
3. Show the summary text in the conversation

### Why Skill Prompt (Not Hook)

- `/recap` is user-initiated, not event-driven
- The model needs to read its own context to summarize
- A skill prompt is the natural interface for "do something and speak it"

---

## DES-006: Plugin Hook Registration

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How notification hooks are registered in the plugin

### Design

Hooks are declared in `hooks/hooks.json` and registered by the plugin system. The notification hooks are:

```json
{
  "Stop": [{
    "hooks": [{
      "type": "command",
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/notify.sh"
    }]
  }],
  "Notification": [
    {
      "matcher": "permission_prompt",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/notify-permission.sh",
        "async": true
      }]
    },
    {
      "matcher": "idle_prompt",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/notify-permission.sh",
        "async": true
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why Separate Scripts

- Stop hook (synchronous, returns JSON decision) has different logic than Notification hook (async, calls CLI)
- Separate scripts keep each handler focused and testable
- The permission and idle hooks share the same script (both announce a message)

---

## DES-007: MCP Tool Naming — Voice Domain Vocabulary

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** MCP tool names visible in the UI panel

### Design

Renamed the four MCP tools from clinical/technical names to voice/audio-themed names:

| Old (clinical) | New (on-brand) | Why |
|----------------|---------------|-----|
| `synthesize` | `speak` | The natural verb for giving voice to text |
| `synthesize_batch` | `chorus` | Multiple texts at once, like a chorus |
| `synthesize_pair` | `duet` | Two texts stitched together |
| `synthesize_pair_batch` | `ensemble` | Multiple pairs, like an ensemble |

CLI command names (`tts synthesize`, `tts batch`, etc.) and internal Python API are unchanged — only the MCP tool names visible in the UI.

### Why This Matters

MCP tool names appear in the tool-result panel every time a tool is called. "synthesize" reads like a chemistry lab; "speak" reads like what the plugin actually does. Follows the dungeon plugin pattern where `load`/`save`/`delete` became `recall`/`inscribe`/`obliterate`.

---

## DES-008: Two-Channel Display — Panel + Model Context

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How MCP tool results display in the Claude Code UI

### Design

The PostToolUse hook (`suppress-output.sh`) splits tool output into two channels:

1. **`updatedMCPToolOutput`** — Compact panel line with `♪` prefix, voice, and provider:
   - `♪ "Hello world" — matilda (elevenlabs)`
   - `♪♪ 3 tracks — matilda (elevenlabs)`
   - `♪ "Hello | Hallo" — matilda+hans (elevenlabs)`
   - `♪♪ 5 pairs — matilda (elevenlabs)`

2. **`additionalContext`** — Full JSON result for the model to reference paths, metadata, etc.

Follows the two-channel display pattern from punt-kit/patterns/two-channel-display.md.

### Why `♪`

Biff uses `▶` as its visual glyph. `♪` (musical note) is the natural symbol for a voice/audio plugin — instantly recognizable, visually distinct from other plugins.

---

## DES-009: Notification Phrase Variation

**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How permission/idle notifications avoid repetitive phrasing

### Design

The notification hook (`notify-permission.sh`) selects from a pool of 7 natural-sounding phrases per notification type using bash `$RANDOM`. Avoids the robotic repetition of hearing "Needs your approval" every time.

Phrases are stored directly in the script (no external config). Selection uses a Bash 3.2-compatible `pick_random` function that takes array elements as positional arguments (no namerefs).

---

## DES-010: Plugin Install-or-Update — Never Leave Users on Old Versions

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How `tts install` handles already-installed plugins

### Problem

`claude plugin install tts@punt-labs` returns non-zero with "already installed" when the plugin exists. Our installer treated this as success and moved on. Users on old versions had **no update path** — they were stuck unless they manually ran `claude plugin uninstall` + `install`.

This was invisible for a long time because the developer always has the latest (editable install). It only surfaced when a second machine ran the install script after a version bump.

### Design

Install follows an install-or-update pattern:

```text
claude plugin install tts@punt-labs
  ├── exit 0              → installed (fresh)
  ├── "already installed" → claude plugin update tts@punt-labs
  │     ├── exit 0           → updated
  │     ├── "up to date"     → already up to date (success)
  │     └── other error      → fail with message
  └── other error         → fail with message
```

### Key Details

- `_install_plugin()` calls `_update_plugin()` on the "already installed" path — single responsibility per function
- `_update_plugin()` handles three outcomes: updated, already current, error
- `install.sh` does not need changes — it calls `tts install` which delegates to `installer.py`
- The `claude plugin update` subcommand was discovered empirically via `claude plugin --help`; it is not documented in public Claude Code docs as of 2026-02-26

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Always uninstall then reinstall | Destructive; removes user's plugin state; slower |
| Tell users to manually update | Poor UX; they won't know to do it |
| Check version before install | No reliable way to query installed plugin version from CLI |

## DES-011: install.sh Under `set -eu` — Guard Expected Failures

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How install.sh handles commands that may fail

### Problem

`install.sh` uses `set -eu` for safety. A bare command that exits non-zero kills the entire script before any error message can print:

```bash
set -eu
"$BINARY" install       # exits non-zero → script dies silently
INSTALL_EXIT=$?          # never reached
```

This was discovered when a user ran `install.sh` from a directory with no git repo. `tts install` (which runs `claude plugin install` → git clone) failed, and the script exited silently after "Setting up Claude Code plugin..." with no error message.

### Design

Wrap expected-failure commands in `if !` guards:

```bash
if ! "$BINARY" install; then
  fail "Plugin install failed"
fi
```

The `if` construct exempts the command from `set -e` — a non-zero exit runs the else branch instead of killing the script. This is POSIX-standard behavior.

### Rule

**Any command in `install.sh` that might legitimately fail must use `if !` or `||` to handle the failure path.** Bare commands are only safe for operations that should always succeed (like `printf`).

### Context

The user ran `install.sh` from a non-git directory. The SSH fallback added an HTTPS git rewrite, but `tts install` still failed (possibly because `claude plugin install` needs a working git clone and the environment was unusual). The silent exit meant the user had to manually diagnose and run `tts install` themselves.

---

## DES-012: Per-Project Config — Not Global

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** SETTLED (path evolved: `.vox/config.md` → `.punt-labs/vox/vox.md` + `vox.local.md` in DES-036)
**Topic:** Where TTS plugin state (notify, speak, voice) is stored

### Problem

The original state file was `~/.claude/tts.local.md` — a global path shared across all Claude Code sessions in all projects. Enabling `/notify y` in one project enabled it everywhere. This is wrong: notification preferences are per-project.

### Design

State moved to per-project config in the repo root. Originally `.vox/config.md`, now `.punt-labs/vox/vox.md` (durable, tracked) + `vox.local.md` (ephemeral, gitignored). See DES-036 for the two-file split rationale.

### Why This Works

- Config directory follows the org filesystem standard (`.punt-labs/<tool>/`)
- Hooks run in the project root, so relative paths resolve correctly
- Each project gets independent `/notify`, `/speak`, `/voice` settings
- Durable prefs are tracked in git; ephemeral state is gitignored

### Migration

No migration needed from global to per-project. The `.vox/` → `.punt-labs/vox/` migration was handled by auto-migration in `vox install` and `vox daemon install` (v4.6.0).

## DES-013: Serialized Audio Playback via flock

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How concurrent audio playback from MCP tools, Stop hook, and Notification hook is coordinated

### Problem

Three independent audio playback paths can fire simultaneously:

1. **MCP tools** — `speak`/`chorus`/`duet`/`ensemble` in `server.py` play audio after synthesis
2. **Stop hook** — `notify.sh` plays `chime_done.mp3` on task completion
3. **Notification hook** — `notify-permission.sh` plays chime or synthesized speech

When multiple paths fire at once, audio overlaps (cacophony). PR #17 attempted PID-based kill-previous — it prevented overlap but silenced the interrupted speaker.

### Design

Every playback invocation acquires `LOCK_EX` on `~/.punt-labs/vox/playback.lock`, runs `afplay` synchronously, then releases. Concurrent callers block on the lock and play in turn.

```text
Process A: flock(LOCK_EX) → afplay file1.mp3 → release
Process B:     [blocked]  ──────────────────→ flock(LOCK_EX) → afplay file2.mp3 → release
```

Two entry points in `playback.py`:

- `play_audio(path)` — blocking: flock → afplay → release
- `enqueue(path)` — non-blocking: spawn detached subprocess that calls `play_audio`

Bash hooks call `vox play <path>` (thin CLI wrapper). The MCP server calls `enqueue()` directly.

### Why fcntl.flock

- Zero infrastructure — no daemon, no message queue, no PID tracking
- Cross-process serialization — works across MCP server, hook scripts, CLI
- Self-cleaning — lock auto-releases on process exit, even crashes
- No audio killed — every utterance succeeds, just queued

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| PID-based kill-previous (PR #17) | Silences the interrupted speaker — user wants all utterances to succeed |
| Daemon with Unix socket | Operational complexity, lifecycle management, crash recovery |
| Named pipe (FIFO) | Requires a reader process; same daemon problem |
| No coordination (status quo) | Audio overlap is cacophonous |

### Platform Scope

`fcntl.flock` is POSIX (macOS + Linux). The audio player is resolved at
runtime: `afplay` (macOS native) → `ffplay` (cross-platform, from ffmpeg).
ffmpeg is already a project dependency (pydub uses it for audio processing).

---

## DES-014: Dev/Prod Namespace Isolation

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How the plugin can be tested from the working tree alongside the installed production plugin

### Problem

`claude --plugin-dir .` loads the working tree as a plugin, but it collides with the installed production `vox` plugin if both use the same name. Developers cannot test plugin changes (hooks, commands, MCP tools) without uninstalling the production plugin first.

### Design

The working tree uses `"name": "vox-dev"` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Claude Code treats `vox` and `vox-dev` as separate plugins:

- **Prod tools**: `mcp__plugin_vox_vox__speak` (from installed plugin)
- **Dev tools**: `mcp__plugin_vox-dev_vox__speak` (from `--plugin-dir .`)

Dev commands (`say-dev.md`, `recap-dev.md`) in `.claude/commands/` reference dev-namespaced tools. Prod commands in `commands/` are unchanged.

The MCP server uses the installed `vox` binary as its command. With editable installs (`uv tool install --force --editable .`), the installed binary runs working-tree code — no `uv run` needed.

Release scripts (`scripts/release-plugin.sh`) swap `vox-dev` → `vox` and remove `*-dev.md` files before tagging. `scripts/restore-dev-plugin.sh` reverses this after tagging.

### Session-Start Hook Dispatch

The session-start hook detects dev mode by checking plugin.json for `"vox-dev"`:

- **Dev mode**: skip command deployment (prod plugin deploys top-level commands), auto-allow `mcp__plugin_vox-dev_vox__*`
- **Prod mode**: deploy commands to `~/.claude/commands/`, auto-allow `mcp__plugin_vox_vox__*`

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `uv run` in plugin.json/hooks | Unacceptable production dependency — users may not have `uv` installed |
| Single namespace, uninstall prod to test | Destroys the production plugin; cannot test both simultaneously |
| Separate repo for dev plugin | Duplicates code; impossible to keep in sync |

### Key Invariant

The installed `vox` binary always runs working-tree code (via editable install). This means hooks, MCP server, and CLI all exercise the current source without `uv run`.

## DES-015: Marketplace Installs from HEAD, Not Tags

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Why the v0.4.0 production install was broken and the systemic fix

### Root Cause

Claude Code marketplace installs clone HEAD of the default branch, not the version tag. When a marketplace entry has no `source.ref` field, `claude plugin install` resolves the `version` field for display only — the git clone targets HEAD.

This is invisible when HEAD and the tag are the same commit. It becomes a breaking defect when they diverge — which is exactly what dev/prod namespace isolation does. The release workflow pushes three commits in sequence:

```text
main:  ... → [release] → [prepare: name=vox] → [restore: name=vox-dev]
                              ↑ tag v0.4.0           ↑ HEAD
```

The tag points to the prepare commit (`name: "vox"`). HEAD points to the restore commit (`name: "vox-dev"`). The marketplace installs HEAD — so every user gets the dev plugin.

### Consequences of Installing the Dev Plugin

1. Plugin loads as `vox-dev`, not `vox`
2. Session-start hook detects `DEV_MODE=true`, skips command deployment
3. No top-level `/notify`, `/say`, `/speak`, `/recap`, `/voice` commands
4. User sees only namespaced commands: `/vox-dev:notify`, `/vox-dev:say`, etc.
5. Tool permission auto-allow writes the dev pattern (`mcp__plugin_vox-dev_vox__*`)

The plugin technically works — MCP server starts, audio plays — but the UX is wrong. The user has no idea they're running a dev build.

### Why This Wasn't Caught

1. The developer uses an editable install + `--plugin-dir .`, so the dev name is expected
2. The release script round-trip test verified the scripts work, not the installed artifact
3. No test installs from the marketplace after release — verification step 10 tests PyPI (`tts doctor`), not the plugin
4. Biff has the same dev/prod pattern but its HEAD happened to have the prod name at install time (no release had been cut since adding the pattern)

### Fix (Two Parts)

**Part 1: Pin `source.ref` in marketplace.json.**

Every marketplace entry must specify the release tag:

```json
{
  "name": "tts",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "punt-labs/vox",
    "ref": "v0.4.0"
  },
  "version": "0.4.0"
}
```

This is required for any project where HEAD of main may diverge from the release tag — which is every project using dev/prod namespace isolation, and arguably every project where post-release commits exist.

**Part 2: Refresh the marketplace clone before plugin install.**

Pinning `source.ref` in the remote marketplace.json only helps when the local clone has the pin. Existing users whose marketplace clone predates the pin see the old marketplace.json without `source.ref` — and `claude plugin install` resolves HEAD again.

The installer must refresh the marketplace clone before running `claude plugin install`, using the supported CLI command:

```python
def _refresh_marketplace() -> StepResult:
    claude = shutil.which("claude")
    if not claude:
        return StepResult("Marketplace refresh", False, "claude CLI not found on PATH")
    result = subprocess.run(
        [claude, "plugin", "marketplace", "update", MARKETPLACE_KEY],
        capture_output=True, text=True, check=False,
    )
    ...
```

This uses `claude plugin marketplace update` rather than operating on the clone directly, consistent with DES-002 (CLI over config file editing). New users (no clone yet) get a fresh clone with current marketplace.json. Existing users get the latest `source.ref` pins before install.

### Rule

**Every marketplace entry MUST have `source.ref` pinned to the release tag.** The release workflow step 12 (marketplace bump) must update both `version` and `ref`. This is now documented in CLAUDE.md.

**Every installer MUST refresh the marketplace clone before `claude plugin install`.** The `_refresh_marketplace()` step runs `claude plugin marketplace update punt-labs` so existing users pick up ref pins from newer marketplace.json versions.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Don't push restore commit to main | Breaks the dev workflow — developer's working tree would have prod name, defeating namespace isolation |
| Tag HEAD instead of the prepare commit | Tag would include dev artifacts; marketplace clones the tag and gets `vox-dev` anyway |
| File a Claude Code bug to resolve `version` → tag | Correct long-term fix, but we can't control Claude Code's release timeline; `ref` is the available mechanism now |
| Keep main always prod-ready, dev on branches | Every feature branch would need manual plugin.json swap; error-prone, defeats the automation |
| Only pin `source.ref`, skip refresh | Existing users with stale clones never see the pin — install still resolves HEAD |

### Discovery Chain

1. User installed v0.4.0, saw `/vox-dev:notify` instead of `/notify`
2. Checked installed plugin cache: `name: "vox-dev"`, commit `06c2ec7` (restore commit)
3. Compared to v0.4.0 tag: commit `c977c8c` (prepare commit), `name: "vox"`
4. Confirmed: marketplace installed HEAD, not tag
5. Added `source.ref: "v0.4.0"` to marketplace, nuked cache, reinstalled → `name: "tts"`, correct commit
6. Discovered stale clone problem: existing users whose clone predates the ref pin still get HEAD
7. Added `_refresh_marketplace()` to installer — pulls latest marketplace.json before install

## DES-016: Command Deployment Must Update, Not Skip-If-Exists

**Date:** 2026-03-05
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How SessionStart hook deploys top-level commands to `~/.claude/commands/`

### Problem

The SessionStart hook deployed commands with a skip-if-exists guard:

```bash
# WRONG: stale commands persist forever
if [[ ! -f "$dest" ]]; then
  cp "$cmd_file" "$dest"
fi
```

This meant that once a command file was deployed, it **never updated** — even across plugin upgrades and releases. Users accumulated stale command files with:

- Old `allowed-tools` (e.g., `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` instead of `Bash`)
- Old MCP tool names (e.g., `mcp__plugin_tts_vox__speak` from before the rename)
- Old implementation logic (prompt-driven config file editing instead of CLI calls)

The `/vox`, `/unmute`, `/mute`, `/vibe`, and `/recap` commands were all stale. Some still referenced tool names from 3+ releases ago.

### Why This Wasn't Caught

1. The developer uses `--plugin-dir .` (dev mode), which skips command deployment entirely
2. Editable install means the developer's `vox` binary runs working-tree code
3. The stale commands still "worked" — Claude could figure out the intent even with wrong tools — just not correctly
4. No integration test for "install plugin, upgrade, verify commands updated"

### Root Cause

The original skip-if-exists logic was written to be idempotent for first-run setup. The assumption was that commands don't change across releases. That assumption was wrong from day one — commands have changed in almost every release since the plugin launched.

### Fix

Compare content with `diff -q` and overwrite when different:

```bash
# CORRECT: update changed commands
mkdir -p "$COMMANDS_DIR"
if [[ ! -f "$dest" ]] || ! diff -q "$cmd_file" "$dest" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  cp "$cmd_file" "$dest"
fi
```

### Scope

Fixed in all Punt Labs plugins:

- `vox/hooks/session-start.sh`
- `biff/hooks/session-start.sh`
- `dungeon/hooks/session-start.sh`

Updated in `punt-kit/standards/plugins.md` — the standard now mandates diff-and-update with correct/incorrect code examples.

### Rule

**SessionStart command deployment must always update stale files.** Never skip-if-exists for command deployment. The cost of an unnecessary copy is zero. The cost of a stale command is a broken user experience that persists across every session until the user manually deletes the file.

## DES-017: Call Path Performance — MCP over Bash, Hooks over LLM

**Date:** 2026-03-05
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Which call paths perform best for LLM-initiated and event-driven operations

### Benchmark

Measured 10 sequential calls through each path (apples-to-apples, one model
round-trip per call):

| Path | Avg per call | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **LLM → MCP tool** | ~3.2s | Persistent stdio server, no process spawn. Response is structured JSON. |
| **LLM → Bash → CLI** | ~4.6s | Model round-trip + Python process spawn (~110ms) + text parsing. |
| **Shell hook → CLI** | ~110ms | No model involvement. Direct process execution. |

The model round-trip dominates both LLM paths (~3s of inference per call).
MCP wins over Bash because the server is already running (no spawn cost) and
returns structured data. Shell hooks calling CLI directly are ~30x faster
because they bypass the model entirely.

### Two fast paths

```text
Model-initiated:    LLM ──► MCP server (persistent, structured)
Event-driven:       Hook ──► CLI (no LLM, direct execution)
```

**LLM → MCP** for operations the model initiates: synthesis, voice queries,
config changes. The MCP server is a long-running process — zero startup cost,
structured JSON responses, PostToolUse hooks for UI formatting.

**Hook → CLI** for event-driven operations: stop notifications, permission
chimes, signal tracking. Shell hooks call `vox` CLI directly — no model
round-trip, no inference latency. The hook reads config with grep/sed and
calls the CLI in ~110ms total.

### The slow path (avoid)

```text
LLM ──► Bash ──► CLI    (worst of both worlds)
```

LLM → Bash → CLI combines model round-trip overhead with process spawn
overhead. Every Bash call spawns a fresh Python process (~110ms), and the
model still pays ~3s of inference to generate and parse the call. Use this
only when no MCP tool exists for the operation.

### The Read/Write antipattern (never)

```text
LLM ──► Read(.punt-labs/vox/vox.md)    (file I/O through the model layer)
```

Never instruct the model to Read or Write config files directly. This
couples the model to file format details, bypasses the CLI's validation
logic, and is no faster than an MCP call. If the model needs config state,
either pass it in hook context (zero cost) or expose it via an MCP tool.

### Rule

**Model-initiated operations go through MCP. Event-driven operations go
through shell hooks calling CLI. The model should never touch config files
directly — use the CLI or MCP layer.**

## DES-018: Clean Stop Hook Reason — No Internal Data in User-Visible Output

**Date:** 2026-03-06
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** What the Stop hook's `reason` field contains

### Problem

The Stop hook's `decision: "block"` response includes a `reason` field that Claude shows to the user as assistant output. Early implementations leaked internal state into this field:

```json
{"decision": "block", "reason": "♪ Saying my piece... | vibe_mode=auto vibe_tags=[calm] vibe_signals=tests-pass@14:32,lint-pass@14:33"}
```

The pipe-separated metadata was intended for the model to thread through to the `unmute` MCP tool. But the entire reason string is displayed in the chat, so users saw raw config data after every task completion.

### Design

The `reason` field contains **only** a `♪`-prefixed phrase — nothing else:

```json
{"decision": "block", "reason": "♪ Saying my piece..."}
```

Vibe tags are resolved deterministically from accumulated signals and written to `vox.local.md` **before** the block response. When Claude calls `unmute` in the continuation turn, `apply_vibe()` reads tags from config automatically. No data passes through the reason string.

```text
Stop hook fires →
  1. resolve_tags_from_signals(config.vibe_signals) → "[relieved]"
  2. write_fields({"vibe_tags": "[relieved]", "vibe_signals": ""})  # atomic
  3. return {"decision": "block", "reason": "♪ Saying my piece..."}

Claude continues →
  4. Generates 1-2 sentence summary
  5. Calls unmute MCP tool → apply_vibe() reads vibe_tags from config
```

### Key Details

- **`resolve_tags_from_signals()`** maps signal counts and trajectory to 1-2 ElevenLabs expressive tags without LLM involvement. Deterministic: same signals always produce the same tags.
- **Signal consumption**: `write_fields()` atomically writes resolved tags AND clears `vibe_signals` in a single config update. This prevents signals from accumulating across stop cycles.
- **Vibe mode gating**: Auto mode resolves and writes tags. Manual mode with existing tags skips (user's choice preserved). Off mode skips entirely.

### Why Config-Mediated Tag Passing

The alternative — embedding tags in the reason string for Claude to extract and pass to the MCP tool — couples the user-visible output to internal data. Any change to tag format or signal structure changes what users see. Config-mediated passing decouples them completely: the hook writes to config, the MCP tool reads from config, and the reason string is free to be a simple human-friendly phrase.

### Rule

**The Stop hook `reason` field must contain only a user-friendly phrase.** No config data, no metadata, no pipe-separated fields. If the continuation turn needs data, write it to config before returning the block response.

## DES-019: Bluetooth Audio Lead-In Silence

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Status:** SETTLED (current solution adequate; alternatives documented for future)
**Topic:** First syllable clipped on Bluetooth audio devices (AirPods)

### Problem

When playing TTS audio after a period of silence (2+ seconds), Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, others) clip the first ~300-500ms of audio. The user hears "...esting one two three" instead of "Testing one two three."

### Root Cause

Bluetooth A2DP audio devices enter a low-power state when no audio is playing. When audio suddenly starts, the Bluetooth controller needs ~300-500ms to:

1. Wake the radio from low-power mode
2. Re-negotiate the audio codec (AAC/SBC)
3. Fill the jitter buffer before playback begins

Audio frames transmitted during this wake-up window are dropped by the device. This is Bluetooth hardware behavior — not fixable in software without compensating for it.

### Why Vox Normally Masks This

In typical sessions, hooks fire frequently enough (chimes on permission prompts, quips on task completion, acknowledgment beeps) that the Bluetooth link stays in active mode. The gap between audio events is usually under 2 seconds — not long enough to trigger low-power transition.

The problem surfaces when there's a deliberate gap: recording → Scribe STT (~700ms) → TTS synthesis (~1000ms) → playback. That ~2 second silence is enough for AirPods to sleep.

### Current Solution

Prepend 500ms of silence to audio before playback:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
silence = AudioSegment.silent(duration=500)
speech = AudioSegment.from_mp3(audio_path)
combined = silence + speech
combined.export(padded_path, format="mp3")
```

The silence gives the Bluetooth controller something disposable to drop during wake-up. The user perceives no added latency because the 500ms would have been silent anyway (device was waking up).

### Scope

Currently applied only in the voice-loop spike script (`.tmp/spike-voice-loop.py`). Not yet integrated into the main playback pipeline (`playback.py`), which doesn't have this problem in normal usage because hooks keep the link warm.

### Future Alternatives

If the current approach proves insufficient or the problem surfaces in main playback:

| Approach | Mechanism | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Inaudible keepalive** | Play sub-perceptible tone (~20Hz, -60dB) during synthesis gaps to keep the Bluetooth link active | Prevents the problem entirely; requires background audio thread; may affect battery |
| **CoreAudio device latency query** | Read `kAudioDevicePropertyLatency` and `kAudioDevicePropertySafetyOffset` via CoreAudio API to get actual device latency dynamically | Exact padding per device; macOS-only; requires PyObjC or ctypes bindings |
| **Bluetooth detection** | Query output device type via `sounddevice.query_devices()` or `system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType`; only pad when output is Bluetooth | No wasted silence on wired/built-in speakers; adds platform-specific detection logic |
| **Adaptive padding** | Start with 500ms, measure whether the first syllable is audible (via loopback or user feedback), adjust dynamically | Self-tuning; complex to implement; hard to measure "audibility" programmatically |

### Rule

**When playing audio after a gap of 2+ seconds, assume Bluetooth devices may need wake-up time.** The 500ms silence prefix is the simplest correct solution. Do not reduce it below 500ms without testing on AirPods.

## DES-020: Turn-Based Voice Conversation with Claude Code

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Topic:** Architecture for voice input/output conversation loop in Claude Code

### Goal

Enable turn-based voice conversation with Claude: the user speaks instead of typing, Claude speaks its responses (already works via Stop hook + `/unmute`), and the loop repeats. Voice and keyboard coexist — the user can type a prompt at any time instead of speaking.

### The "Who Presses Enter?" Problem

Claude Code's turn model is user-initiated. Only the user typing and pressing Enter starts a new model turn. No plugin API exists to inject a user prompt programmatically. The voice transcript must somehow trigger Claude to start a new turn.

### Rejected Approaches

| Approach | Why Not |
|----------|---------|
| **Blocking MCP tool** (`listen` tool blocks until user speaks) | MCP tools shouldn't block indefinitely; ties up the tool call; doesn't fit the MCP interaction model |
| **`tools/list_changed` notification** | Delivers the transcript to Claude's tool list, but Claude is idle waiting for user input — the notification doesn't trigger a new turn |
| **User types "go" after speaking** | Defeats the purpose — speaking AND typing is worse than just typing |
| **Stop hook injects transcript as reason** | Only works at task completion boundaries; can't start a cold conversation with voice |

### Proposed Design: Background Task Notification Loop

The solution uses Claude Code's existing background task mechanism (`run_in_background`). A background process blocks until voice input is ready, then exits. Claude receives a `<task-notification>` with the transcript — this triggers a new model turn.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Conversation Loop                                               │

│  Claude finishes task                                           │
│    → Stop hook: speaks summary (existing behavior)              │
│    → Claude spawns: `vox listen --wait` (run_in_background)     │
│    → Claude stops                                               │
│                                                                 │
│  User speaks in Lux panel whenever ready                        │
│    → Daemon: mic capture → Scribe STT → transcript ready        │
│    → `vox listen --wait` detects ready → prints transcript      │
│    → exits                                                      │
│                                                                 │
│  Claude receives <task-notification>                            │
│    → reads transcript from task output                          │
│    → acts on the instruction                                    │
│    → spawns next `vox listen --wait`                            │
│    → loop continues                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Properties

- **No new Claude Code APIs.** Background tasks and task notifications are existing, proven mechanisms.
- **No timeout pressure.** The listener blocks until the user speaks — 5 seconds or 5 minutes.
- **Self-sustaining loop.** Each task completion spawns the next listener. Stops when voice mode is disabled.
- **Keyboard coexists.** If the user types a prompt before speaking, the background listener is killed or ignored. No conflict.
- **Only when enabled.** The listener is spawned only when voice input mode is active. Normal sessions are unaffected.

### `vox listen --wait` Command

Thin CLI command that:

1. Connects to the vox daemon (WebSocket or polling)
2. Blocks until a transcript is marked ready
3. Prints the transcript to stdout
4. Exits with code 0

If the daemon is unreachable or voice mode is disabled, exits immediately with code 1. No retry, no backoff — the caller (Claude) decides whether to respawn.

### Lux Voice Panel

The Lux window provides the visual interface for recording:

- **Record button** — starts mic capture via the daemon
- **Stop button** — ends recording, triggers Scribe transcription
- **Transcript display** — shows the transcribed text for review
- **Edit field** — user can correct Scribe mistakes before sending
- **Send button** — marks transcript as ready (unblocks `listen --wait`)
- **Discard button** — clears transcript, returns to idle state

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Status |
|------------|--------|
| ElevenLabs Scribe STT | Proven in spike (700ms latency for 5s clip) |
| ElevenLabs TTS playback | Shipping (existing provider) |
| Bluetooth lead-in silence (DES-019) | Proven in spike (500ms padding) |
| Mic capture (`sounddevice`) | Proven in spike |
| Lux interactive elements | Available (buttons, text inputs, recv) |
| mcp-proxy daemon model | Shipped (DES-021) |
| `vox listen --wait` CLI command | Not built |
| Daemon-side transcript store | Not built |

### Phasing

1. **Spike (done):** Prove mic → Scribe → TTS round-trip works (`.tmp/spike-voice-loop.py`)
2. **mcp-proxy migration (done, DES-021):** Move vox to the daemon model so the daemon can own the mic, Scribe client, Lux connection, and transcript store
3. **`listen --wait` command:** CLI that blocks on the daemon's transcript-ready signal
4. **Lux voice panel:** Record/stop/send UI in the Lux window
5. **Conversation loop integration:** Stop hook spawns `listen --wait` in background when voice mode is active

### Open Questions

1. **How does the first turn start?** The loop is self-sustaining once running, but the initial `listen --wait` needs to be spawned. A `/voice` command could spawn the first listener.
2. **Concurrent listeners:** If the user types a prompt while `listen --wait` is running, the background task should be killed or its result ignored. How does Claude handle a stale task notification that arrives after a typed prompt?
3. **VAD vs button:** The Lux panel uses explicit Record/Stop buttons. Future enhancement: VAD-based auto-detection (start recording on speech, stop on silence) for hands-free operation.
4. **Error recovery:** If Scribe fails or returns garbage, the user sees it in the Lux panel and can discard. But `listen --wait` should also handle daemon disconnection gracefully.
5. **Multi-session:** With the daemon model, multiple Claude Code sessions could have voice mode enabled. The daemon needs per-session transcript state (keyed by session_key from mcp-proxy).

## DES-021: Daemon Mode — Single Process with mcp-proxy

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** SUPERSEDED by DES-028

> **Note:** This ADR describes the v2 mcp-proxy daemon design. The production implementation now uses `voxd` (DES-028) — a simpler audio server without mcp-proxy, ContextVar, or PID-based CWD resolution.

**Topic:** Convert vox from per-session MCP processes to a single daemon

### Problem

Each Claude Code session spawns its own `vox mcp` process (~19MB each). With 10+ sessions, that's 10+ independent processes, each with its own TTS provider, playback queue, and hook handlers. Three concrete problems:

1. **Duplicate audio**: `biff wall` sends the same notification to all sessions → each synthesizes and plays identical TTS independently
2. **Resource waste**: 10+ Python processes doing the same work
3. **Hook latency**: Each hook invocation cold-starts Python (~500ms) to call `vox hook <event>`

### Design

Single long-running daemon fronted by mcp-proxy (same pattern as quarry, DES-020 prerequisite):

```text
MCP bridge (long-lived, per-session):
                    stdio                      WebSocket
Claude Code ◄──────────────► mcp-proxy ◄──────────────────────► vox serve
             MCP JSON-RPC    (~6MB Go)       ws://localhost:8421  (one daemon)
                                              /mcp

Hook relay (one-shot, per-event):
                    stdin/stdout                WebSocket
Hook script ──────────────────► mcp-proxy ──────────────────────► vox serve
             JSON payload       (~15ms)        ws://localhost:8421  (same daemon)
                                               /hook
```

Falls back to `vox mcp` (stdio) and `vox hook <event>` (subprocess) when daemon/mcp-proxy unavailable.

### Key decisions

**Starlette ASGI over plain WebSocket server** — Reuses the pattern from quarry's `http_server.py`. Starlette provides routing, lifespan management, and test client support. uvicorn handles signal handling and graceful shutdown.

**ContextVar for per-session config isolation** — Each MCP WebSocket connection sets `_config_path_override` via ContextVar so `resolve_config_path()` returns the correct project's `.vox/config.md` without passing paths through every function. The ContextVar is reset when the connection closes.

**CWD resolution from PID** — When a session connects with `?session_key=<pid>`, the daemon looks up the process's cwd via `lsof` (macOS) or `/proc/<pid>/cwd` (Linux) to find the right `.vox/config.md`. This is resolved once and cached in the session registry.

**Audio deduplication** — `DaemonContext.should_play(cache_key)` returns False if the same notification type was played within 5 seconds. Checked on the event loop thread (before `asyncio.to_thread` dispatch) to avoid data races. Prevents biff-wall duplicate audio across sessions.

**Graceful fallback** — Plugin.json uses `sh -c "if command -v mcp-proxy; then exec mcp-proxy ws://...; else exec vox mcp; fi"`. Hook scripts try `mcp-proxy --hook` first, fall back to `vox hook <event>`. Users without mcp-proxy or without the daemon running get identical behavior to before.

### Alternatives considered

1. **Unix domain socket instead of WebSocket** — Simpler but mcp-proxy speaks WebSocket natively. UDS would require a custom transport.
2. **Shared process group** — Use multiprocessing to share state. Too fragile across crash/restart cycles.
3. **Redis/IPC for dedup** — Over-engineered. The daemon is single-process; a dict with monotonic timestamps is sufficient.

### Files

- `src/punt_vox/daemon.py` — Starlette app with /mcp, /hook, /health
- `src/punt_vox/service.py` — launchd/systemd service management
- `src/punt_vox/config.py` — Added `_config_path_override` ContextVar
- `src/punt_vox/server.py` — Added `run_mcp_session()` for WebSocket transport
- `src/punt_vox/__main__.py` — `vox serve`, `vox daemon install/uninstall/status`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — mcp-proxy fallback
- `hooks/*.sh` — Daemon-first relay with subprocess fallback

## DES-022: AskUserQuestion Works Inside Slash Commands

**Date:** 2026-03-20
**Status:** SETTLED (verified, test artifact removed)
**Topic:** Whether `AskUserQuestion` renders inside skill/command execution

### Finding

A test command (`commands/ask-test-dev.md`) verified that `AskUserQuestion` with options renders correctly inside a slash command. The tool presents a picker UI and returns the selected option. This confirms commands can use interactive prompts for user input, not just static instructions.

### Outcome

Test passed. The `ask-test-dev.md` scaffold was removed — it served its purpose and has no production value. Commands that need user choices (e.g., voice selection in `/unmute`) can use `AskUserQuestion` with confidence.

## DES-023: Assets Bundled in Python Package

**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How chime MP3 files are distributed and resolved at runtime

### Problem

Chime audio never played in daemon mode or from the installed `vox` binary. `_resolve_assets_dir()` had two strategies:

1. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` env var → `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/assets/` — works for Claude Code hook scripts
2. `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent / "assets"` → walks up to repo root — works for editable installs from the source tree

Strategy 2 fails for the installed package: `__file__` resolves to `site-packages/punt_vox/hooks.py`, so `.parent.parent.parent` = `site-packages/`, and `site-packages/assets/` doesn't exist. The daemon process runs from the installed binary with no `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, so every chime resolution failed silently ("missing chime_done.mp3" in logs).

### Design

Move canonical assets into the Python package: `assets/` → `src/punt_vox/assets/` (subpackage with `__init__.py`). `uv_build` auto-discovers and includes them in the wheel.

Fallback path becomes `Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "assets"` — sibling to the module files. Works for editable installs, installed packages, and daemon mode.

A symlink at repo root (`assets` → `src/punt_vox/assets`) preserves the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/assets/` resolution path for Claude Code hook scripts.

### Why Subpackage, Not `data` Config

`uv_build`'s `data` directive installs files into a platform-specific `.data/` directory in the wheel, not alongside the Python modules. Files there aren't findable via `__file__`-relative paths. Making `assets/` a subpackage (with `__init__.py`) puts the MP3s directly in `site-packages/punt_vox/assets/`, co-located and trivially resolvable.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `importlib.resources` | Adds complexity; `Path(__file__).parent / "assets"` is simpler and works for all cases |
| Copy assets at install time via post-install hook | `uv` doesn't support post-install hooks; fragile |
| Resolve from Claude plugin installation directory | Fragile — depends on knowing the plugin install path, which varies |
| Keep assets at repo root, fix `__file__` traversal | Three `.parent` calls is fragile and breaks when package layout changes |

## DES-024: Daemon Lifecycle — Kill Process on Uninstall, Detect Stale on Install

**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How `vox daemon install` and `vox daemon uninstall` handle running processes

### Problem

Two lifecycle bugs discovered while deploying the DES-023 asset fix:

1. **`vox daemon uninstall`** removed the launchd plist but left the daemon process running. The old process continued serving on port 8421 with pre-fix code, invisible to the user.

2. **`vox daemon install`** did not detect a stale process occupying port 8421. `launchctl load` failed silently (or the new process couldn't bind), but `_launchd_status()` showed the service as "loaded" — so install reported success while the old process kept running.

Both bugs compound: uninstall leaves a zombie, install doesn't detect it, user thinks they upgraded but nothing changed.

### Design

A shared `_kill_stale_daemon()` helper used by both install and uninstall:

```text
_kill_stale_daemon():
  1. Read port from ~/.punt-labs/vox/serve.port (fallback: DEFAULT_PORT)
  2. Find PID via lsof -ti :<port> (macOS) or fuser <port>/tcp (Linux)
  3. SIGTERM → wait up to 5s → SIGKILL if still alive
  4. Remove serve.port (serve.token is preserved for session continuity)
```

- **Uninstall** calls `_kill_stale_daemon()` after removing the service config
- **Install** calls `_kill_stale_daemon()` before registering the new service

### Why SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL

The daemon runs a Starlette ASGI server with active WebSocket connections. SIGTERM triggers uvicorn's graceful shutdown (closes connections, runs lifespan shutdown). SIGKILL is the fallback for hung processes — 5 seconds is generous for a local daemon with no persistent state.

### Why Not Just `launchctl kickstart`

`launchctl kickstart -k` can restart a service, but it requires the service to be loaded. If the plist was removed (uninstall) or never loaded (stale process from a previous install), kickstart has nothing to act on. Directly killing the process is the only reliable approach.

## DES-025: Daemon Provider Key Resolution via keys.env

**Date:** 2026-03-28
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How the daemon gets API keys for TTS providers when launchd/systemd strip the shell environment

### Problem

The vox daemon runs as a launchd (macOS) or systemd (Linux) service. These init systems start processes with a minimal environment — no direnv, no shell profile, no API keys. Without `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the daemon falls back to `say` (macOS) or `espeak` (Linux) — system TTS that sounds terrible.

Before the daemon existed, vox ran inside Claude Code's process and inherited the shell environment. The daemon broke that model.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Embed API keys in the launchd plist / systemd unit** — Keys would be visible in the service config file. More importantly, the plist is written at install time from whatever shell runs `vox daemon install`. If that shell doesn't have direnv loaded (e.g., running from a directory without `.envrc`), no keys get embedded. Fragile and non-obvious.

2. **Pass keys per-request via MCP protocol** — Would preserve the "your shell controls your provider" model, but adds complexity to the MCP wire protocol, requires changes to every MCP tool, and means the daemon can't auto-detect providers at startup. Also raises questions about key transit security over localhost WebSocket.

3. **Read keys from macOS Keychain / Linux secret-service** — Not portable. Keychain is user-specific setup, not something every vox user would have. Not a general solution.

### Design

A dedicated config file at `~/.punt-labs/vox/keys.env` (same path on macOS and Linux). Simple `KEY=VALUE` format, chmod 0600.

**Write path:** `vox daemon install` calls `_write_keys_env()` in service.py. This snapshots provider-relevant env vars (`ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AWS_*`, `TTS_PROVIDER`, `TTS_MODEL`) from the caller's shell into the per-user config file at `~/.punt-labs/vox/keys.env`. Runs as the installing user — no sudo for the file write.

**Read path:** `voxd` calls `_load_keys()` at startup, before logging or provider auto-detection. Sets `os.environ` for keys not already present. This means:

- launchd/systemd daemon: loads all keys from file (nothing in env)
- Manual `voxd` from shell with direnv: env vars already set, file keys ignored

**Resolution order:** shell env var > keys.env value > provider unavailable.

### Why a Flat File, Not TOML/YAML

The file is never sourced by a shell. It's parsed by a 15-line Python function. No quoting, no escaping, no schema. One `KEY=VALUE` per line, `#` comments, blank lines ignored. The simplest format that works.

## DES-026: Stable Auth Token Across Daemon Restarts

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

The daemon generated a fresh auth token (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) on every startup. Clients already connected held the old token. When the daemon restarted, all existing client connections failed authentication.

### Decision

The auth token is generated once and persisted to `<run_dir>/serve.token` (chmod 0600). It is stable across daemon restarts. The run dir is `~/.punt-labs/vox/run/` on both macOS and Linux.

- `voxd` startup (`_read_or_create_token()`): reads the token from file. If the file is missing, generates and persists one.
- The token file is NOT removed on daemon shutdown (unlike `serve.port`, which is removed to signal the daemon is down).

### Why Not Remove Auth Entirely

The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1`, so only local processes can connect. Removing auth was considered (same trust model as Docker daemon default, Redis default). Rejected because:

1. Multi-user systems: other users on the same machine could connect.
2. Defense in depth: the token costs nothing and prevents accidental tool invocation by other local MCP clients.
3. The token mechanism already exists and works — removing it is churn with no upside.

### Rejected: Token Rotation on Every Install

The original design (regenerate on install) was simpler but broke the reconnection invariant. mcp-proxy's reconnect logic (exponential backoff, caps at 5s) works correctly only when the URL is stable. Changing the token on install means the daemon must either: (a) accept both old and new tokens during a grace period, or (b) require all clients to re-read the token file. Both are more complex than simply keeping the token stable.

## DES-027: Data Directory Migration to ~/.punt-labs/vox/

**Status:** SETTLED (reinstated after DES-028 rollback)

> **Note:** DES-027 migrated daemon data from `~/.punt-vox/` to `~/.punt-labs/vox/`. DES-028 (v3) briefly moved daemon data to system paths (`/etc/vox/`, `/var/log/vox/`, `/var/run/vox/` on Linux; Homebrew-prefix equivalents on macOS), but that move stranded user API keys on upgrade and required sudo to edit personal tokens. It was rolled back in the v4.x branch and daemon state lives under `~/.punt-labs/vox/` on both platforms again. See DES-028 for the settled state and the rollback rationale.

## DES-028: Vox v3 — Audio Server Architecture

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

The v2 daemon tried to know which project a client belonged to. It resolved CWDs from PIDs via `lsof`, read/wrote `.vox/config.md` in project directories, and used ContextVars to isolate per-session config. Every piece of this chain broke — 8 rounds of path bugs. The root cause was architecture, not code.

### Decision

One machine, one set of speakers, one audio daemon (`voxd`). Clients send text + parameters. The daemon synthesizes and plays. It knows nothing about projects, sessions, CWDs, or Claude Code.

**Two entry points, one package:**

- `voxd` — per-user audio daemon. Owns speakers, providers, playback queue, dedup, cache. All daemon state lives under `~/.punt-labs/vox/` on both macOS and Linux.
- `vox` — everything else. CLI, MCP server (`vox mcp`), hook handlers. All are clients of `voxd`.

**Wire protocol:** WebSocket + JSON messages. Streaming-capable for future real-time voice conversation.

**MCP server:** Lightweight stdio process per Claude Code session. Session state in memory. Finds `.punt-labs/vox/` by walking up from CWD (same as biff). Reads `vox.md` (durable prefs) and `vox.local.md` (ephemeral state). Calls `voxd` via WebSocket for synthesis/playback. No provider imports — cold start < 500ms.

**Hooks:** Three-layer dispatch unchanged (hooks.md standard). Python handlers call `voxd` via WebSocket client. No in-process synthesis.

**Service install:** macOS: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.punt-labs.voxd.plist` — user-level LaunchAgent, no sudo required (migrated from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` in DES-038). Linux: `/etc/systemd/system/voxd.service` with `User=` installing user — sudo required to place the unit file. All per-user state under `~/.punt-labs/vox/` is created with normal user permissions on both platforms.

### Why Not Keep the Proxy Architecture

mcp-proxy existed to avoid spawning a Python process per session. The new MCP server is lightweight (no provider imports) so Python startup cost is acceptable. Eliminating mcp-proxy removes a Go binary dependency, the WebSocket MCP bridge, and the entire class of "MCP session doesn't survive daemon restart" bugs.

### Why WebSocket, Not HTTP

HTTP request/response can't do bidirectional streaming. Real-time voice conversation (vox-7hr) needs streaming audio in both directions. WebSocket handles both fire-and-forget synthesis (today) and streaming conversation (future) without a protocol change.

### System Paths

All per-user state lives under the installing user's home dir — same layout on macOS and Linux. Only the system service unit lives in a platform-specific system directory.

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Config (API keys) | `~/.punt-labs/vox/keys.env` |
| Logs | `~/.punt-labs/vox/logs/voxd.log` |
| Runtime (port, token) | `~/.punt-labs/vox/run/serve.{port,token}` |
| Cache | `~/.punt-labs/vox/cache/` |
| Service (macOS) | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.punt-labs.voxd.plist` (DES-038) |
| Service (Linux) | `/etc/systemd/system/voxd.service` |

### Why Per-User Paths, Not System Directories

The v3 rewrite (DES-028 original) tried FHS system paths (`/etc/vox/`, `/var/log/vox/`, `/var/run/vox/`) on Linux and Homebrew-prefix equivalents on macOS. That was wrong: `voxd` runs as a single user (`User=` in the systemd unit, `UserName` in the launchd plist), so its state is per-user, not system-shared. The system-path model stranded existing users' API keys on upgrade, required sudo to edit personal tokens, and created a chown mismatch where the file voxd was told to read was owned by root. State now lives under `~/.punt-labs/vox/` on both platforms — same as any other per-user daemon (`~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, and the other Punt Labs agent tools under `~/.punt-labs/`).

### Service Identity

`voxd` runs as the installing user, not root. Audio device access (CoreAudio on macOS, PulseAudio/PipeWire on Linux) is tied to the desktop session user. The LaunchDaemon plist sets `UserName` to the installing user; the systemd unit sets `User=` to the installing user. `vox daemon install` itself runs as the normal user and refuses to start under `sudo` — it prompts for a sudo password only to place the unit/plist file into its system directory and to reload the daemon manager. Every per-user file is created with normal user permissions. See DES-029 for the privilege-scoping rationale.

## DES-029: Scope `sudo` to System Service Installation Only

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

The initial v4 `vox daemon install` ran the entire install command under `sudo`. The CLI wrapper was `sudo vox daemon install` and the Python code was left to handle "I am running as root but the data belongs to $SUDO_USER." That meant: reading `SUDO_USER` from the environment, resolving the target user's home dir via `pwd.getpwnam`, chowning every created directory back to that user, opening `keys.env` with `O_NOFOLLOW|O_EXCL|O_CREAT`, verifying the open descriptor with `fstat`, calling `fchown` on the descriptor, rejecting symlinks anywhere in the ancestor chain — an increasingly baroque pile of privilege-defense code whose only purpose was to protect root from a user-controlled directory tree.

Each review round added another layer: Cursor Bugbot found that chowning `state_root.parent` (`~/.punt-labs`) could hand root-owned system paths to the user if the parent was a symlink, so the code added an explicit parent-symlink check. Another round found that `O_TRUNC` without `O_NOFOLLOW` could redirect the privileged write to `/etc/shadow`, so the code added `O_NOFOLLOW`. Another round found that the plist baked in `/var/root/.punt-labs/` paths because `Path.home()` under `sudo` pointed at root's home, so the code added `_user_state_dir_for(target_user)`. The stack kept growing. No finding was invalid — all of them were real — but each one was paying down interest on the wrong architectural choice.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Keep root-inside-$HOME and harden each review-cycle finding individually** — sustainable only as long as review rounds keep finding every hole. Symlink/TOCTOU/chown-ordering bugs compound quickly in privileged code. The surface was already three layers deep (path walk, `O_NOFOLLOW`, `fchown` on the fd) and still growing.
2. **Use `sudo -u $SUDO_USER` to re-exec the user-owned portion** — gets the permissions right but introduces two process boundaries mid-command, complicates error propagation, and still leaves "the parent process runs as root" as the user's observable reality.

### Decision

`vox daemon install` runs as the invoking user from start to finish. The command refuses to run under `sudo` (`os.geteuid() == 0` check at the top of `install()`). All per-user filesystem writes under `~/.punt-labs/vox/` happen with normal user permissions — no chown, no `fchown`, no `O_NOFOLLOW`, no symlink walks, no `SUDO_USER` lookup. The privileged surface shrinks to five `subprocess.run(["sudo", ...])` calls on Linux and four on macOS, each touching only a system directory the user could not write to anyway:

**Linux (5 calls):**

1. `sudo systemctl stop voxd` (pre-flight, skipped on fresh install)
2. `sudo install -m 644 -o root -g root <tmp> /etc/systemd/system/voxd.service`
3. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. `sudo systemctl enable voxd`
5. `sudo systemctl restart voxd`

**macOS (0 calls — DES-038):**

DES-038 moved the macOS plist from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`. LaunchAgents are user-owned — no sudo required for any steady-state operation. The one-time migration from the old LaunchDaemon uses 2 sudo calls (`unload` old plist + `rm` old plist), then never again.

The unit/plist content is written directly to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (macOS, user-writable) or to a user-owned tmp file then placed via `install(1)` into `/etc/systemd/system/` (Linux, root-writable).

### Why the Pre-flight Stop

Review round 3 (Cursor Bugbot 3048416720) found that `install()` was calling `_ensure_port_free` (which issues a direct `os.kill(SIGTERM)` to the stale voxd PID) before running the platform-specific install path. On macOS, launchd's `KeepAlive=true` immediately respawned the killed daemon with the OLD plist; on Linux, systemd's `Restart=on-failure` treated the kill as a failure exit and restarted the process under the old unit. The upgrade flow was racing against the service manager.

The fix is a pre-flight stop through the service manager (`_launchd_stop` on macOS, `_systemd_stop` on Linux) BEFORE `_ensure_port_free` runs. That tells the manager "I am going to kill this, do not respawn it." The subsequent port check is then idempotent: anything still listening is stale state that survived a manager crash and is safe to kill outright. Both pre-flight helpers are idempotent — fresh installs with no prior unit file skip the sudo call entirely, so the fresh-install shape is 4 calls on Linux and 3 on macOS (pre-flight is a no-op; unit write + reload + enable + restart for Linux, install + load + kickstart for macOS).

### Why Restart, Not Enable --now

Review round 2 found that `systemctl enable --now` does not restart an already-running service, so on upgrade the running voxd would keep the stale `ExecStart` baked in from the previous unit. The Linux install shape uses `enable` + `restart` as separate primitives: `enable` is the boot-persistence step (idempotent), `restart` is the unconditional cycle. The macOS shape adds `launchctl kickstart -k` after `load` — `load` on an already-loaded plist is a no-op and does not restart the daemon, so `kickstart -k` is the only primitive that forces a reload of the new `ExecStart`.

### Why Refuse `sudo` Instead of Silently Demoting

If a user runs `sudo vox daemon install` out of habit, the three wrong things happen: `getpass.getuser()` returns `root`, `Path.home()` resolves to `/root`, and all per-user state lands under `/root/.punt-labs/vox/` (invisible to the normal user, and the generated systemd unit has `User=root`, so the daemon runs as root and loses audio device access). Silently demoting with `os.seteuid` + `os.setegid` would fix the ownership but would leave the habits unchanged — the user would still run the command wrong next time, and the failure mode would become "works on my machine." Explicit refusal with a clear error message retrains the habit.

### Why This Deletes More Code Than It Adds

The initial refactor commit shipped -443 net lines across 10 files. The deletions were all the defensive code that no longer has anything to defend: `_reject_symlinks`, `_chown_to_user`, `_user_keys_env_file_for`, `_user_state_dir_for`, `_installing_user`, the `target_uid`/`target_gid` parameters of `_write_keys_env`, the `_open_new`/`_open_existing`/`O_NOFOLLOW`/`O_EXCL`/`fstat`/`fchown` dance, the `SUDO_USER` environment lookup, the parent-symlink check, the `os.lchown` calls in `_ensure_user_dirs`, and every test that exercised those code paths. The only defensive code that survived is the control-character validation in `_write_keys_env` (rejecting `\n`/`\r`/`\x00` in env values) — that is input sanitization, not a privilege defense, and applies equally when the process runs as the user.

## DES-030: Music Playback — Separate Subprocess at Reduced Volume

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

Music tracks loop for minutes. The existing `_playback_consumer` queue and `_playback_mutex` handle short audio (chimes, TTS) with a 30-second timeout. If music used the same queue, it would hold the mutex for the entire track duration, blocking all chimes and speech.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **SIGSTOP/SIGCONT** — pause the music subprocess when speech needs to play, resume after. POSIX-portable, but creates an unnatural silence gap. Users don't stop their music when someone talks to them; they turn it down.
2. **PulseAudio/PipeWire dynamic ducking** — lower the music stream's volume via `pactl set-sink-input-volume` when speech fires. Correct UX, but requires runtime PulseAudio/PipeWire detection, stream identification, and volume state management. Complexity disproportionate to v1.
3. **Shared playback queue with long timeout** — raise the timeout to 5 minutes. Simple, but blocks all TTS for the entire track duration since `_playback_mutex` is held.

### Decision

Music plays via its own ffplay subprocess at `-volume 30` (Linux) / `--volume 0.3` (macOS), completely outside the existing playback queue. Speech and chimes play at full volume through the normal queue and overlay on top. No pausing, no ducking, no mutex contention. The volume differential makes speech intelligible over the background music without any runtime coordination. Dynamic ducking via PulseAudio is a future enhancement.

## DES-031: Music Session Ownership Model

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

voxd is shared across all Claude Code sessions and CLI users. Music is daemon-wide (one set of speakers, one music loop). When multiple sessions are active, which session's vibe drives the music?

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Last-active session wins** — whichever session most recently changed its vibe sends that to voxd. Simple, but jarring: switching terminals flips the music based on which one you last typed in.
2. **Music has its own vibe, independent of per-repo vibe** — `/music on style techno` sets a music-specific mood on voxd. Per-repo `/vibe` stays separate. Simplest to implement but loses the reactive-to-vibe behavior.

### Decision

The session that runs `/music on` **owns** the music. That session's vibe drives the music prompt. Other sessions' vibe changes do not affect the music. Ownership transfers when another session explicitly runs `/music on` (which claims it) or `/music off` (which stops it). Each MCP server generates a `session_id` (UUID) at startup, sent as `owner_id` with every music message. voxd rejects `music_vibe` messages from non-owning sessions.

## DES-032: Duration-Proportional Playback Timeout

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

`_PLAYBACK_TIMEOUT_S = 30.0` was a fixed constant that killed ffplay after 30 seconds. Set when vox only played short chimes and quips. A 480-character recap generates 34.3 seconds of speech at ElevenLabs default rate — the timeout fires at 87%, cutting mid-word. Any TTS over ~450 characters is silently truncated.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Raise the fixed timeout to 120s** — simple, but leaves a hard ceiling that longer content will eventually hit again. Also means a stuck ffplay process takes 2 minutes to detect instead of 30 seconds.
2. **No timeout** — removes the safety net for hung processes entirely. A single stuck ffplay would block the playback queue permanently.

### Decision

Probe the file duration via `ffprobe -v quiet -show_entries format=duration` before spawning the player. Set timeout to `max(duration + 10s, 30s)`. A 34s file gets 44s. A 2-minute file gets 130s. Short files keep the 30s floor. Probe failure degrades gracefully to the 30s default. The probe runs in <10ms for local files and adds negligible latency.

## DES-033: Gapless Music Handoff on Vibe Change

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

When the session vibe changes while music is playing, a new track must be generated (~10-30s). The naive approach — kill the old track, generate, play the new one — creates an audible silence gap during generation.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Kill immediately, accept the silence** — the first implementation (PR #194 commit ae79d9f). Simple but produces 10-30s of dead air every time the vibe changes. Users expect continuous background music.
2. **Break out of the playback loop, generate, then restart** — old track finishes its current iteration but doesn't re-loop during generation. If generation takes longer than the remaining track duration, silence returns. Also orphans the ffplay subprocess (Bugbot caught this).
3. **Pre-generate the next track speculatively** — generate a track for every possible vibe in advance. Wastes credits on tracks that may never play.

### Decision

Run generation as a concurrent `asyncio.Task` while the playback loop continues looping the old track. On each playback iteration, the loop races `proc.wait()`, `music_changed.wait()`, and the generation task. Handoff (kill old proc, switch to new track) happens only when the generation task completes. A second vibe change during generation cancels the in-flight task and starts a fresh one — old track keeps looping throughout. The old track plays continuously from the moment `/music on` fires until `/music off` or a new track is ready.

## DES-034: Peer-Closed WebSocket — State Check vs Widened Exception

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

After the vox-ehf fix in v4.3.0, chime/unmute clients return on the `"playing"` ack and close the WebSocket. The next `receive_text()` call raises `RuntimeError` (not `WebSocketDisconnect`), logging a full traceback on every chime.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Widen the except clause to `(WebSocketDisconnect, RuntimeError)`** — the initial fix (PR #185 commit a191a3c). Correct for the specific case, but catches *any* RuntimeError in the handler chain. Copilot flagged it: a future handler raising RuntimeError for a real bug would be silently swallowed. The widened surface was unnecessarily broad for a fix that only needed to handle the disconnect state.

### Decision

Check `websocket.application_state != WebSocketState.CONNECTED` at the top of the receive loop, before `receive_text()` is called. If disconnected, `break` cleanly. The outer `except` clause stays narrow (`WebSocketDisconnect` only). A genuine `RuntimeError` from a handler still surfaces as an ERROR log. Two complementary tests document the narrowing guarantee: one verifies the state check preempts a disconnected-socket error, the other verifies an unexpected RuntimeError still logs as an error.

## DES-035: Track Naming and Zero-Credit Replay

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

Generated music tracks are saved to `~/Music/vox/tracks/` but only identifiable by timestamped filenames. Users can't find a track they liked, can't replay it without regenerating (burning credits), and can't build a personal library.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **Hash-based naming** — name tracks by content hash (MD5/SHA256 of the audio). Unique and collision-free, but human-unreadable. A user can't find "that techno track from Tuesday" by scanning filenames.
2. **No replay — always regenerate** — simplest implementation, but ElevenLabs generation is non-deterministic (same prompt produces different tracks). A track the user liked is gone forever once the loop moves on. Also wastes ~2000 credits per replay.

### Decision

Auto-name tracks as `{vibe}-{style}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}` (e.g. `happy-techno-20260412-1118`). Users can provide custom names via `/music on --name late-night-flow`. When a name matches an existing file in `~/Music/vox/tracks/`, skip generation entirely and loop the saved track — zero credits, instant playback. `/music play <name>` replays any saved track. `/music list` shows the library with name, size, and date. The `music_replay` flag in `DaemonContext` tells `MusicLoop` to skip generation and go straight to the playback loop.

## DES-036: Config Split — Durable Prefs vs Ephemeral State

**Date:** 2026-05-11
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Why per-repo config is two files instead of one

### Problem

The single `.vox/config.md` mixed durable preferences (voice, provider, notify mode) with ephemeral session state (current vibe, vibe tags, accumulated signals). This caused two problems:

1. **Tracked/untracked conflict.** Users wanted to commit their voice and provider preferences (team defaults), but `vibe_signals` changes every few seconds during a session — committing the file would produce constant noise.
2. **Directory location.** `.vox/` was a non-standard location. The org filesystem standard puts per-tool config under `.punt-labs/<tool>/`.

### Design

Two files under `.punt-labs/vox/`:

- **`vox.md`** — tracked in git. Durable preferences: `voice`, `provider`, `model`, `notify`, `speak`, `vibe_mode`. These are team-sharable defaults.
- **`vox.local.md`** — gitignored. Ephemeral session state: `vibe`, `vibe_tags`, `vibe_signals`. These change during a session and have no value across sessions.

Field routing is explicit: `DURABLE_KEYS` and `EPHEMERAL_KEYS` frozensets in `config.py` determine which file a field reads from and writes to. `read_field()`, `write_field()`, and `write_fields()` handle the routing transparently.

The `config_path` parameter throughout the API became `config_dir` — callers pass a directory, and the read/write helpers resolve to the correct file within it.

### Why Two Files, Not Gitignore Patterns

A single file that is partially tracked requires `.gitignore` gymnastics or `git update-index --assume-unchanged`, both of which are fragile and confusing. Two files with clear ownership (tracked vs gitignored) is the standard pattern used by `.envrc` (tracked) + `.envrc.local` (gitignored).

### Migration

Auto-migration from `.vox/config.md` was handled by `vox install` and `vox daemon install` in v4.6.0. The v4.7.5 release removed `.vox/` entirely — no legacy fallback reads.

## DES-037: Remote voxd Connectivity via Env Vars

**Status:** SETTLED

### Problem

voxd binds to `127.0.0.1` and clients discover port/token from local files. Users who SSH from machine A (with speakers) to machine B (headless server) cannot hear audio — synthesis and playback both happen on B, which has no audio device. SSH reverse tunnels proved the protocol works remotely, but required manual file creation on B and stopping B's voxd to avoid port collisions.

### Rejected Alternatives

1. **SSH tunnel only (no code changes)** — works but fragile: requires manual `serve.port`/`serve.token` file creation, port collision if B runs its own voxd, tunnel dies with the session.
2. **mcp-proxy bridging** — the pattern lux uses for remote display. Vox's remote need is at the `VoxClient → voxd` layer, not the `Claude Code → vox mcp` MCP transport. Wrong connection to configure.
3. **Full TLS on voxd** — overkill for audio playback. Token auth is sufficient; SSH tunnel covers untrusted networks.

### Decision

Four env vars — three client-side, one server-side:

- `VOXD_HOST` (client): WebSocket host, default `127.0.0.1`
- `VOXD_PORT` (client): WebSocket port, default from `serve.port` file
- `VOXD_TOKEN` (client): auth token, default from `serve.token` file
- `VOXD_BIND` (server): bind address via `typer.Option(envvar="VOXD_BIND")`, default `127.0.0.1`

Resolution: explicit arg > env var > file > default. Two deployment models: direct network (same LAN) and SSH tunnel (different networks). Token auth is the security boundary. Access logs redact tokens. Users configure via `.envrc`. See `docs/guide-remote-setup.md` for the setup guide.

## DES-038: LaunchAgent over LaunchDaemon — Eliminate macOS Background Throttling

**Date:** 2026-05-27
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Move voxd from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`

### Problem

macOS throttles LaunchDaemon processes (CPU QoS demotion, I/O deprioritization, thermal back-pressure). voxd synthesis measured 7x slower via LaunchDaemon vs manual launch: 17.4s vs 2.4s for a 38-character text. Every operation was uniformly slower — ElevenLabs API (4x), ffmpeg/pydub (19x), provider construction (11x). Texts over ~300 characters exceeded the 30-second client timeout.

### Decision

Move the plist from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.punt-labs.voxd.plist` (system domain, root-owned) to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.punt-labs.voxd.plist` (user domain, user-owned). LaunchAgents run at user QoS without background throttling.

**Plist changes**: remove `UserName` (invalid for LaunchAgents), add `ProcessType=Interactive` (prevents App Nap throttling on the windowless daemon). Use `launchctl bootstrap`/`bootout` (modern syntax) instead of deprecated `load`/`unload`.

**Fresh install**: no sudo. `mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents`, write plist, `ensure_port_free()`, `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid> <plist>`, `launchctl kickstart`.

**Migration** (old LaunchDaemon exists): originally shipped as an automated path — write new plist, `sudo launchctl unload -w` the old system-domain plist, `ensure_port_free()`, `launchctl bootstrap` the new LaunchAgent, verify health, `sudo rm` old plist. **Removed 2026-07-01 — see Amendment below.**

### Why Not Keep the LaunchDaemon

| Alternative | Rejected |
|---|---|
| `ProcessType=Interactive` on LaunchDaemon | Undocumented for daemons |
| `Nice=-5` | Root-only, CPU-only, not I/O |
| Raise client timeout to 120s | Masks symptom, users still wait 17s |
| `bootstrap gui/<uid>` with LaunchDaemon plist | Mixing domains is unsupported |

### Supersedes

DES-028 §Service install (macOS): path changed from `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
DES-029 §macOS sudo calls: reduced from 4 steady-state to 0. (The 2 migration-only calls that briefly remained were removed — see Amendment.)

### Amendment (2026-07-01): migration path removed

The automated LaunchDaemon→LaunchAgent migration described above was removed before it ever shipped in a release (it lived only in `[Unreleased]`). Rationale:

- **Only ~3 total installs exist**, all on team machines. A one-time manual cleanup is cheaper than carrying, testing, and maintaining a one-shot migration path that becomes dead code the moment those machines are migrated.
- **It's a backwards-compat shim** — `PL-PP-1` forbids these ("if something is removed, it is removed completely").
- **It carried a live defect**: the final `sudo rm` of the old plist used `check=True`, so any sudo auth failure (no tty, wrong password, cancel) aborted `vox daemon install` with a traceback and exit 1 — even though the new LaunchAgent was already installed, booted, and health-checked. Every other step in the migration tolerated failure with `check=False`; only the least-important cleanup step hard-failed. Removing the path deletes the defect instead of fixing an edge case in dead code.

**Consequence:** `_install_darwin()` now runs the clean path unconditionally (stop → `ensure_port_free` → install → bootstrap → kickstart) with **zero sudo on macOS for both install and uninstall**. The `check_stale_launch_daemon()` doctor check (which only nagged users to migrate) and the `_OLD_LAUNCHD_PLIST` constant are gone. The pre-release machines that still carry the old system plist are cleaned up once, by hand:

```bash
sudo launchctl bootout system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.punt-labs.voxd.plist 2>/dev/null
sudo rm -f /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.punt-labs.voxd.plist
```

Closes vox-zt3r. Shipped in v4.9.0.

## DES-039: Self-Driving Playlist — Eager Background Fill, Auto-Advance, Prefetch

**Date:** 2026-07-04
**Status:** SETTLED
**Ticket:** vox-1rxb (rebuild of bas7 / #291)

### Problem

bas7 (#291) shipped the wrong music UX. On track-end, `MusicLoop` respawns the
*same* file (`loop.py`: "Subprocess ended naturally — Return the same
current_track so the caller respawns it"), and the pool only grows when the user
runs `/music next`. Result: `/music on` plays one track that loops forever.
Confirmed by smoke test — pool stuck at 1, same track repeating. The subsystem
was built around the manual-skip path; the unattended listening experience was
never validated.

The root cause is a conflation of two concerns in one `gen_task`: the loop used a
single generation task to *both* prepare the next handoff track *and* (never)
grow the pool. Generation only fired on a `changed` signal, so nothing ran
"forward" of playback. There was no continuous supply and no auto-advance.

### Target behavior (operator-locked)

Put music on and forget it:

1. `/music on` (or a vibe change) generates track #1 and plays it the instant it
   is ready.
2. Immediately, the remaining tracks for that `(vibe, style)` pool generate in
   the **background, one at a time (sequential)**, until the pool reaches
   `POOL_SIZE` (12).
3. Playback **auto-advances**: when a track ends the next one plays with no
   command. Because background fill runs far ahead of ~3-min playback, the next
   track is already on disk — prefetch is a *consequence*, not separate
   machinery. Only while just track #1 exists does it loop #1 until #2 lands,
   then advance.
4. Once the pool has 12, generation stops and playback **auto-rotates** (shuffle,
   never the just-played track) among the 12 forever, at zero credits.
5. A vibe/style change **finishes the current song**, then switches to the new
   pool: resume background fill if that pool has < 12, else rotate.

### State / flow model

Four states own the daemon-wide music subsystem. The state is a derived view of
`(mode, pool-on-disk-count, fill-task-alive)`, not a stored enum to keep in sync.

```

- **off / idle** — `mode == "off"`, no player subprocess, no fill task.
- **generating-first** — `mode == "on"`, pool empty, fill task producing #1, no
  playback yet. The handler returns `"generating"` immediately; generation is off
  the handler's critical path.
- **playing+filling** — a track is playing and the fill task is alive
  (`pool < 12`). Track-end **advances** by selecting from the growing on-disk
  pool.
- **full / rotating** — a track is playing, the fill task has exited
  (`pool ≥ 12`). Track-end **rotates** (shuffle-avoid-last) with zero generation.

**Auto-advance on track-end.** The player subprocess ending is the trigger. The
loop asks the scheduler for the next track — a pure selection over the current
on-disk pool: `TrackPool.from_paths(gen.tracks_for(prefix)).pick_next(last)`. On a
one-element pool `pick_next` returns that same element (loops #1); once fill has
landed #2 it returns a different element (auto-advance); on a full pool it rotates
avoiding the just-played track. The "loop-#1-until-#2-lands" edge is not special
cased — it falls out of `pick_next`.

**Prefetch readiness** is therefore implicit: advance always reads the *current*
on-disk pool. If fill kept ahead (it always does at 3 min/track vs seconds/gen),
a fresh track is present. Readiness reduces to "does `pick_next(last) != last`" —
a consequence of the fill running forward, with no separate prefetch state or
task.

**The cancellable sequential background-fill task.** A new `PoolFiller` owns
exactly one `asyncio.Task`. Its body is `while not pool.is_full: await
generate_one()` — sequential by construction. It is retargeted or cancelled
through two methods:

- `ensure_running(vibe, style)` — if a task is alive for a *different* pool,
  cancel it and (if that pool is `< 12`) spawn a fresh one; if alive for the same
  pool, leave it; if the pool is already full, no-op.
- `cancel()` — cancel the task, awaiting its `CancelledError`, leaving no
  orphaned generation.

The **exactly-one-active-fill** invariant is structural: the class holds at most
one live task and always cancels before spawning.

**Vibe/style change** (finish current song, then switch): `update_vibe`
*immediately* retargets the fill — `PoolFiller.ensure_running(new pool)` cancels
the old pool's fill and starts the new one (bounds credit spend and gives the new
pool a head start) — and marks a pending playback switch. It does **not** kill the
current player. When the current song ends naturally, the loop switches playback
to the new pool (select from disk, or await #1 if the new pool is empty). This
replaces the mid-generation gapless handoff of DES-033 (see Supersedes).

**Restart** (`turn_on` reads the pool from disk): the on-disk count decides the
entry state directly. `≥ 12` → full/rotating, no generation. `1..11` → play a
pool member now, `ensure_running` resumes fill from the current count. `0` →
generating-first.

**`/music off`** — `turn_off` calls `PoolFiller.cancel()` *and* kills the player
in the same synchronous method: no orphaned generation, playback stopped, state
back to idle.

**`/music next`** (manual skip, unchanged role) — advance *now*: kill the player,
select the next track, play it. **`/music play <name>`** (named replay,
unchanged) — play the named track, retarget the pool/fill to that track's pool.

### Invariants preserved (each cited from the contract)

1. **Daemon/client boundary — no business logic in the client layer.** All new
   logic (`PoolFiller`, `select_next_track`, advance-on-end) lives under
   `voxd/music/`. `client.py` is untouched; handlers stay thin parse-and-delegate
   shells with unchanged signatures.
2. **`/music next` stays an optional manual skip; `/music play <name>` stays
   named replay; `/music off` cancels the fill task AND stops playback; gapless
   handoff preserved.** Skip/play/off map to the transitions above. `off` cancels
   fill synchronously. Handoff is now *near-instant* because the next track is
   already on disk — the loop kills the old player and spawns the next
   prefetched file with no generation wait (true zero-gap crossfade remains out
   of scope, as in bas7).
3. **Cache key, `--name` replay path, and deterministic collision-free naming from
   bas7 are unchanged.** Fill generates through the existing
   `TrackGenerator.generate(vibe, style, "")` → `auto_track_name` path; the named
   replay path (`find_track` → replay) is untouched. DES-035 stands.
4. **Reuse `TrackPool` (`is_full`, `pick_next`), `TrackGenerator`, the
   generate-vs-rotate decision.** `pick_next` *is* advance and rotate; `is_full`
   *is* the fill stop condition; the generator is reused verbatim. The
   generate-vs-rotate decision is now *split by owner*: rotate/advance = the loop
   via `select_next_track` (never generates); generate = `PoolFiller` (never
   plays).
5. **No `print()` in daemon code; logs to stderr only.** `PoolFiller` and the
   reduced loop log via `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.

### Rejected alternatives

1. **Prefetch-one-ahead vs eager-fill-all.** Prefetch-one-ahead generates only
   the single next track just-in-time before the current ends. Rejected: it never
   builds a reusable pool, so *every* advance costs credits forever; it couples
   playback duration to generation latency, so a slow generation produces a gap;
   and target behavior #4 explicitly wants zero-credit rotation over a filled
   pool. **Eager-fill-all** builds the 12-track pool once, then rotates free
   forever, and the "prefetched" next track is a side effect of the pool being
   ahead.
2. **Concurrent vs sequential fill.** Concurrent fires all 11 remaining
   generations at once. Rejected (operator-locked): it hits the ElevenLabs
   rate-limits bas7 already tripped; playback at ~3 min/track means one-at-a-time
   stays far ahead regardless; sequential bounds in-flight credit spend and is
   trivially cancellable at a generation boundary. **Sequential** wins on every
   axis here.
3. **Auto-advance in the loop vs a scheduler callback.** A scheduler callback
   would register an on-track-end handler that the subprocess watcher invokes.
   Rejected: the callback needs loop context (kill proc, spawn next), so it pulls
   playback wiring back into the scheduler; and bas7's test failure was precisely
   tests hitting the scheduler directly while the real loop looped one file —
   putting advance behind a scheduler method re-opens that trap. **Advance lives
   in the loop's proc-end branch** and calls the scheduler only for the *pure*
   `select_next_track` decision. Tests drive the loop and observe a real second
   subprocess spawned for a *different* file.
4. **`PoolFiller` owned by the loop vs by the scheduler.** Loop-owned leaves a
   window where the fill task generates one more track after `/music off` before
   the loop notices. **Scheduler-owned** lets `turn_off`/`update_vibe`
   cancel/retarget the fill synchronously — satisfying "off cancels the fill task
   (no orphaned generation)" and "a vibe change cancels the old fill and starts
   the new pool's fill" as locked. The scheduler *delegates* to `PoolFiller`
   (one-line calls); it does not implement the fill loop, so cohesion holds. The
   loop talks only to the scheduler, which is the facade over
   `(generator, pool, filler)`.

### Supersedes

**DES-033 (Gapless Music Handoff on Vibe Change)** — the mid-generation
concurrent-handoff model is replaced. A vibe change no longer loops the old track
while generating the new one; it *finishes the current song* (operator-locked),
having already retargeted the background fill so the new pool is ready. The
`music_changed`-race-plus-gen-task machinery that DES-033 introduced is removed:
the next track is prefetched by the fill task, so there is nothing to wait for at
the handoff. Gapless-ness now comes from the pool being ahead, not from looping
during generation.

### Amendment A (operator, 2026-07-04): disk access behind an injected `TrackStore` protocol

**Status:** SETTLED (operator directive during design review).

The music subsystem must not hard-code filesystem access. All track storage and
retrieval — pool enumeration (`tracks_for`), full listing, find-by-name,
the existence checks the deterministic naming counter relies on, and the write
target for a newly generated track — go through a **`TrackStore` protocol**
(a structural interface, PY-TS-6 / PY-IC-9), **injected** into the components
that need it. Domain code depends on the protocol, never on `Path.glob` /
`pathlib` directly.

- **`FilesystemTrackStore`** is the production implementation; the glob/dir logic
  currently inside `TrackGenerator` moves behind it. The daemon wires it.
- **Injection**: `TrackGenerator` (and, through the scheduler, `PoolFiller`)
  receive the store via their constructor. `daemon.py` constructs the
  `FilesystemTrackStore` and injects it.
- **Tests use an in-memory fake store** — pool-enumeration, selection, fill, and
  restart-from-count tests run with no `tmp_path`, no filesystem, no ffmpeg
  round-trip. (The one place a real MP3 is produced — the provider write path —
  still uses valid silent-MP3 bytes per `TESTING.md`; but the *domain* tests
  that made bas7's suite slow and filesystem-coupled now inject a fake.)
- **Write-set delta**: add the `TrackStore` protocol (in `types.py` per PY-IC-9)
  and a `FilesystemTrackStore` implementation module; inject it through
  `generator.py` → `scheduler.py`/`filler.py` → `daemon.py`. The exact protocol
  surface (method signatures) is settled in implementation; the *contract* — an
  injected, mockable, multi-implementation interface for all disk access — is
  locked here.

**Rationale.** Testability (mock the store: deterministic and fast, and the fill
/ restart / selection paths become unit-testable with zero filesystem), swappable
implementations (the operator's explicit requirement — e.g. an in-memory or
remote store later), and correct dependency direction (PY-IC-8: the domain
depends inward on a protocol, not outward on the filesystem). This also directly
serves the two-goals-together bar: the seam that makes disk access mockable is
the same seam that raises cohesion and testability on `generator.py` and the new
`filler.py`.

## DES-040: Daemon Failures Are Client-Observable Through the API, Not Logs

**Date:** 2026-07-05
**Status:** ACCEPTED (implementation tracked in vox-ig52)
**Topic:** How `voxd` surfaces background-operation failures to clients

### Problem

Background music generation can fail, and when it did the failure was invisible
to every client. Live 2026-07-05: a `/music on` prompt naming composers was
rejected by ElevenLabs (`400 bad_prompt`/ToS). `voxd` logged `Music could not
start; disabling` and raised; the user saw the panel say "generating…" then dead
air. The only record of the reason was in `voxd-stderr.log` — which no MCP
client, CLI caller, or user can read. A feature whose failure is invisible to its
clients is indistinguishable from a hang.

### Design

Every state and failure a client cares about MUST be observable through the
client interface — the MCP tool return value and the `status` tool — never only
in the daemon log. The log is an operator debugging aid, not a client interface.
For music: `status` carries a `music_state`
(`off | generating | playing | rotating | retrying | failed`) plus a
`music_last_error` with an actionable reason (for `bad_prompt`, include the
provider's suggested rewrite so a calling agent can self-correct); permanent
errors go to `failed`, transient ones to `retrying` with bounded backoff while
the existing pool keeps playing. The silent disable is removed.

### Why This Design

This is the daemon-side corollary of the org's Phase-3 verification rule
("observe via the project's introspection APIs"): the introspection surface
(`status`) has to actually carry the failure. It also forces honest
verification — you confirm a feature works by driving it and reading `status`,
not by grepping a log. Operator, 2026-07-05: "Reading logs is not a strategy for
our software clients."

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Log-only (status quo) | Invisible to clients — the failure above |
| Silent disable + retry forever | Hides permanent errors (`bad_prompt`, auth) that never succeed; still tells the client nothing |
| Push notification only, no queryable state | A client that missed the event can't learn current state; the queryable field is the contract, a notification is an optional nicety |

## DES-041: Audio Programs — Ownership-Free, Persisted Program Model (Phase 1)

**Date:** 2026-07-07
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Rebuilding background music as a first-class, persisted, ownership-free Program

### Decision

Background music is rebuilt on a **Program** model — a named, persisted pool of parts plus a manifest, driven by an explicit state machine — replacing the filename-pattern "pool" and the 29-method `MusicScheduler` god-facade. Phase 1 realizes the `playlist` format; `podcast`/`audiobook` are named in the type vocabulary but not built. Design of record: `docs/audio-programs-phase1-design.md`; formal contract: `docs/audio-programs.tex` (a fuzz-clean Z model, 16 state invariants validated by construction).

Key decisions:

- **Ownership removed.** `voxd`'s Program state is machine-universal — any client (MCP session or CLI, from any process) drives any command. The prior session-ownership gate (source of the vox-73m5 stale-vibe bug) is gone. A vibe change is a deliberate music command, never a silent side effect of setting the session mood.
- **Single-writer `ControlChannel`.** Every mutation is a typed `ControlSignal` posted to one FIFO drained by one consumer (O2), so no handler races the Program. A benign lost race (`GuardViolationError`) logs at INFO; a corrupt successor is a bug at ERROR.
- **Persisted + replayable.** Pools save to `~/Music/vox/<name>/` (named by `--name`, else the style; **no `programs/` segment**) with a `manifest.json` and **ID3 tags** on every track, so `/music play <name>` / `list` / `next` / `loop` / `playlist:N` replay from CLI or MCP at zero credits.
- **No migration.** The flat `~/Music/vox/tracks/` layout is not migrated; the `vox music migrate` command and start-up hint from an earlier draft were struck under the org no-migration rule (no installed user base). Forward integration only — `voxd/music/` deleted in the same PRs.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Keep the filename-pattern pool | "It's a naming pattern, not a list" (vox-us4g) — no manifest, no replay, no status |
| Keep session ownership | Complex, bug-ridden (vox-73m5 stale vibe), unusable across sessions (operator, 2026-07-05) |
| Ship a `vox music migrate` bridge | No user base to migrate; a migration bridge is complexity for zero reason (org no-migration rule) |
| Per-vibe pools now | Deferred — Phase 1 keys pools on style (vibe flavors the agent's prompts only); per-vibe identity is `vox-q7vh` (direction A) |

### Shipped deviations from the design

Recorded in `docs/design-review-phase1.md`: the *format-general* claim is partly aspirational (`Program.rotate` raises on `COMPLETE`, no terminal `Mode`, `Subject` is concretely `PlaylistSubject`, so Phases 2–3 build those seams rather than merely supply them); `subject.vibe` records the style, not the session vibe (`vox-q7vh`); the per-command `applied/rejected` wire field is unreachable in Phase 1 (handlers ack at enqueue).

Closes vox-oayr.

## DES-042: The Mic Metaphor — Why the Speak Tool Is `unmute`, Not `say`

**Date:** 2026-07-11
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** The playful mic-metaphor UX, and why the MCP speak tool's name deliberately diverges from the CLI's `vox say`

### Decision

The MCP tool the **agent** calls to speak is named **`unmute`**, and it stays that way. This is a deliberate, playful UX choice, not an inconsistency to be normalized against the CLI.

The tool name renders in the Claude Code tool-result panel (the `♪` line, DES-008) in the moment just before the agent talks. `unmute` reads as *the agent turning mute off on its own mic* — breaking its silence to say something. That framing is the point. It gives the surface the agent drives most a small, coherent piece of character.

The metaphor is a family, not a one-off:

- **`unmute`** — the agent flips its mic on to speak.
- **`/mute`** — mic off; chimes only (the agent goes quiet, DES-004).
- **`who`** — who's at the mic? (the voice roster).
- **`♪`** panel glyph (DES-008) and the voice-vocabulary tool names — `speak`/`chorus`/`duet`/`ensemble` (DES-007).

### Why It Deliberately Diverges From `vox say`

The CLI and the MCP surface have **different actors**, and their verbs correctly reflect that:

| Surface | Actor | Verb | Reads as |
|---------|-------|------|----------|
| CLI | a **human** at a shell | `vox say "hello"` | "say this for me" |
| MCP | the **agent**, on its own initiative | `unmute` tool | "the agent unmutes its mic" |

A user never types `/vox:say "hello"` — the agent speaking arbitrary text on command is not a user action. Users type slash commands (`/vox`, `/vox:mute`, `/vox:unmute`, `/vox:vibe`, `/vox:music`, `/vox:recap`); `/vox:unmute` enables voice mode / sets the session voice, which lives inside the same mic metaphor. `say` belongs to the human/CLI surface; `unmute` belongs to the agent/MCP surface. Unifying them (renaming the tool to `say` for "cross-surface consistency") would flatten an intentional distinction between two different actors and delete the charm — a regression, not a cleanup.

This is distinct from the prfaq's *"Won't Do: agent personality voices"* boundary. That exclusion is about the *audio* not role-playing a character (the voice sounds tired after failures for *signal*, not performance). The mic metaphor is light naming texture in the tool surface — playful, not a persona.

### Rule

**Do not re-flag the `unmute`-vs-`say` divergence as an inconsistency to fix.** It is a settled positioning choice: two surfaces, two actors, two correct verbs. The mic metaphor (`unmute`/`mute`/`who`/`♪`) is deliberate and load-bearing UX charm. New evidence of user confusion — not an agent's tidiness instinct — is the only thing that reopens this.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Rename the MCP `unmute` tool → `say` to match the CLI | Flattens the human-vs-agent actor distinction; the agent "unmuting its mic" is intentional character the panel shows before every utterance; deletes the metaphor |
| Rename the `speak` toggle / consolidate `notify`+`speak` | No surface to match against; the user-facing `/mute`+`/unmute` slashes are shipped, documented product (prfaq FAQ, Feature F4); this is invented scope |

## DES-043: Auto-Vibe Is Agent-Driven, Not Deterministically Classified

**Date:** 2026-07-13
**Status:** SETTLED (supersedes the vibe-signal machinery of DES-018)
**Topic:** How `/vibe auto` derives the session mood

### Decision

Auto-vibe sets the TTS mood from the **conversation, judged by the main agent**, not from any deterministic per-command signal. A non-blocking `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`hooks/vibe-nudge.sh` → `vox hook vibe-nudge`) injects a soft `additionalContext` reminder every Nth user prompt (N=5), **only when `vibe_mode == auto`**, nudging the agent to glance at the session and set the vibe via the `vibe` tool if the mood has shifted — `[happy]` when flowing, `[focused]`/`[frustrated]`/`[weary]` when stuck, `[relieved]` after a fix. The cadence counter (`vibe_nudge_turns`) lives in the ephemeral `vox.local.md`; a `/vibe` mode change and session end reset it.

Design of record: `docs/vibe-agent-driven.md`. **No formal model:** the state that justified the interim Z model (an exit-code window/mood accumulator) is deleted; the replacement is a stateless nudge plus a bounded mod-N counter, below the formal-modeling trigger.

### Why

Two prior deterministic mechanisms failed. (1) The output-pattern classifier grepped command *output* for pytest/ruff/git tokens — **narrow** (only this repo's toolchain), **asymmetric** (a clean exit with no recognized token produced no signal, so successes went uncounted and the mood skewed frustrated everywhere else), and **fragile** (`vox-p0u6` was the acute symptom). (2) An interim exit-code accumulator tried to derive the mood from each Bash command's exit code read from the `PostToolUse` hook — but **that signal does not exist**: Claude Code does not expose the exit code to `PostToolUse` hooks (the `tool_response` carries only `stdout`/`stderr`/`interrupted`/`isImage`/`noOutputExpected`, and the result is finalized *after* the hook runs), confirmed from the Claude Code docs and a live payload capture, so the accumulator recorded nothing. The agent, which sees the whole conversation, holds the success/failure context no per-command hook ever could. Validated by a live spike.

### Consequences

- The exit-code accumulator (`vibe_window`, `vibe_mood`), the `PostToolUse` Bash hook and `BashPayload`, the `vibe_signals` config field, and the interim design doc + Z model (`docs/vibe-exit-code*`) are deleted (forward integration, no shims). `vibe_signals` is replaced by the `vibe_nudge_turns` cadence counter.
- The transcript watcher and the dead mood-pitch chime machinery stay deleted; notification chimes are two flat tones. The mood colors the **spoken voice** (ElevenLabs `vibe_tags`), not chimes.
- The nudge fires only every Nth prompt, so a mood shift inside a short window registers on the next nudge, not instantly — acceptable for ambient TTS mood, and the agent may set the vibe at any time regardless.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Exit-code per command (interim) | The signal does not exist — `PostToolUse` hooks never see the Bash exit code (see Why). |
| Output-pattern classification (DES-018-era) | Narrow, asymmetric, fragile. |
| LLM call inside the hook | The hook runs outside the model context and must be near-instant; an in-hook LLM call is slow, costly, and blind to the conversation the reminder exists to leverage. |
| Nudge every prompt | Nags. The cadence counter throttles to every Nth prompt. |

Closes vox-ek1m.

## DES-044: The Music Panel Speaks Like a DJ — Server-Authored, Not Hook-Composed

**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Where the fun in the `♪` music panel line lives

### Decision

The **server authors** the music panel line (`updatedMCPToolOutput`) with DJ-booth personality, drawing a randomized phrase from a curated pool and filling in the real `style`/`name`. The `suppress-output.sh` hook stays a **dumb echo** of the tool's `.message` (first line, ≤ 80 cols). The dead DJ phrase pools in the hook — which keyed off `.status`/`.style`/`.name` fields the music tools never return, so they never fired — are **deleted** (forward integration, no dead code).

Phrase pools (curated here; the implementation lifts them into the phrase registry, `quips.py` or a sibling, as immutable tuples and selects one per call). Each is `♪`-prefixed at emit and kept short so the prefixed line stays ≤ 80 cols:

- **Music on / generating, with `{style}`:** "dropping a {style} beat" · "{style} in the booth" · "cueing up {style}" · "{style} on the decks" · "spinning up some {style}" · "{style} — beat incoming"
- **Music on / generating, no style:** "beat incoming" · "stepping up to the decks" · "warming up the decks" · "cueing the first track"
- **Music off / stopped:** "fading out" · "that's a wrap" · "decks off" · "last call" · "killing the lights"
- **Replay (`music_play`) with `{name}`:** "now spinning: {name}" · "{name} on the decks" · "{name} on repeat" · "pulling {name} from the crate" · "{name} — encore"
- **Replay, no name (radio):** "back to the crate" · "shuffling the crate" · "radio mode — full crate"
- **Skip (`music_next`):** "mixing the next one in" · "next track loading" · "cueing the next" · "on to the next"

### Why

vox-lf6b's review discovered the hook's DJ pools were unreachable dead code: `music`/`music_play`/`music_list` return only `{message, applied}` / `{message, programs}` — no `.status`/`.style`/`.name` for the hook to branch on — so the panel silently fell back to a generic "♪ music updated", and vox-lf6b corrected the hook to echo the server's plain `.message`. The fun the operator wanted ("fun is a feature") was never shipping. The tool is the one place that holds the real action + style + name, so it is the correct author of a flavored line; the hook is a display surface, not a content generator. This also keeps the phrase logic in Python — testable (pool membership, injected selection) — instead of in bash.

### Consequences

- The hook's `music`/`music_play`/`music_next`/`music_list` DJ phrase pools and their `.status`/`.style`/`.name`/`.tracks` branching are deleted; the hook echoes `.message` and derives the `music_list` count from `.programs` (already true after vox-lf6b).
- The panel line loses the informative "generating a trance track for your `<mood>`" wording in favor of DJ flavor; the agent does not need that wording (control tools carry the stop-narration directive in `additionalContext`, per vox-lf6b).
- Selection is randomized per call; tests assert pool membership and (via an injected chooser) determinism, never a live RNG assertion.
- No genre-alien constraint applies — these are panel *action* phrases, not ElevenLabs music prompts, so the artist/copyright rule of DES-039-era music generation does not govern them.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Hook composes from structured fields | Requires the tools to return `style`/`name`/`status`, widening the tool contract, and keeps hard-to-test phrase logic in bash. The tool already holds the context. |
| Keep the plain server `.message` | Ships correctness but not the fun; the operator explicitly wants the DJ personality. |
| Curate phrases per genre | The panel line is an *action* confirmation, not genre-specific; genre variety belongs in music *generation*, not the panel. |

Closes vox-1jke.

## DES-045: A Mood Change Re-Pools the Music — Hint-Based, Not Coupled

**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How a vibe/mood change drives a music re-pool

### Decision

When the vibe-set tool is called (via `/vibe` **or** the agent's own auto-vibe assessment — no distinction) **and a music Program is playing**, the music re-pools to the `(new_vibe, style)` pool: an existing pool rotates in for free, a new pool generates. When music is **off**, the vibe change updates the speaking mood only — a music no-op. No confirmation, no credit guard.

Crucially, **`vibe()` does not drive playback.** It stays a pure voice-mood tool. It reads music status **read-only** and enriches its *return* with a `music` state object plus an imperative `music_hint` directive — e.g. *"Music is playing (style=flamenco). Author 12 rich flamenco×`<mood>` prompts and call `music(mode=on, style=flamenco, …)`. Do it now."* The **agent** acts on that hint: it authors the 12 rich `(mood × style)` prompts (the mood *colors* the genre) and calls the existing `music` tool, which performs the re-pool via the unchanged `VibeStyleChange` transition. The hint fires only on genuinely-audible modes (`PLAYING_FILLING`/`PLAYING_ROTATING`), never on `FAILED`/`RETRYING`/`OFF`.

### Why

Separation of concerns. `vibe()` is voice direction; driving playback from it couples a mood tool to the music state machine — a layering violation. The return-hint keeps the concerns clean: **vibe = mood, music = music, agent = orchestration.** The imperative directive in the return is the STOP_NARRATION-style device that makes the soft, agent-orchestrated path reliable, and it reuses authoring the agent already does on `/music on style`. Applying it uniformly to manual and auto vibe (rather than gating auto to free rotations) was the operator's call — simpler, and the credit spend is intended.

### Consequences

- `vibe()` gains a read-only music hint in its return and **never posts a switch/music signal** (asserted by test). The `music` tool's re-pool is unchanged — no daemon or state-machine change, so **no Z-model change** (the re-pool is the existing `VibeStyleChange`, still triggered only by the `music` tool).
- The authored style is tracked in a cohesive `MusicPreference` session register, maintained on **every** playback-changing path (`music on` adopts, `music_play` adopts or clears for a union radio, `music off` clears) so the hint always names the genre actually playing.
- Reliability is **soft** (prompt-level — the agent must follow the hint). Mitigated by the imperative directive and made *provable* by the `[vibe-trace]` observability (DES-046).
- Reverses the prior "the session vibe is display/record state; a Program retune is a deliberate music command, never a side effect" decision (the `vibe()` comment), which is struck.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Couple the re-pool inside `vibe()` | Layering violation — a voice-mood tool driving playback internals. The hint keeps concerns separate. |
| Credit guard / confirmation before generating | Operator overrode — the re-pool is the intended effect of a mood change; a confirmation is friction. |
| Flavorless daemon fallback prompt for a new pool | `"<style> music, <mood>. loopable"` is the homogenized tail `/music` forbids; routing the *mood-driven music* feature through it regresses genre fidelity precisely where the feature should shine. |
| Gate the coupling to manual `/vibe` only (auto stays a music no-op) | Operator: no distinction, simpler. Auto and manual both call the vibe tool; both re-pool. |

Closes vox-q1z4.

## DES-046: Prove Soft, Agent-Driven Mechanisms With a Structured Trace

**Date:** 2026-07-16
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** How to verify a prompt-reliant (soft) mechanism actually fires

### Decision

Any **soft, agent-orchestrated** mechanism — one whose correctness depends on the LLM following a hint or nudge rather than a hard code path — MUST emit a stable, greppable structured trace (`[vibe-trace]`) at **each link** of the chain, so a human can *prove* the chain fired or catch a silent gap. For the two current soft mechanisms:

- **auto-vibe (DES-043):** nudge fired → a following vibe-set with `mode=auto`. A nudge with **no** following vibe-set = auto-vibe silently not firing.
- **vibe→music (DES-045):** a vibe-set with `music_playing=true` → a following `music` re-pool. A playing vibe-set with **no** re-pool = the agent dropped the follow-up.

Observability is a first-class deliverable of any such feature, not an afterthought.

### Why

Soft mechanisms cannot be guaranteed by unit tests — the LLM's follow-through is out-of-band from the code. The only way to know they work *in production* is an observable event trail. This generalizes the recurring lesson of this line of work (the `/music` narration that a markdown line failed to enforce; auto-vibe): soft agent behaviors are invisible — and therefore unfalsifiable — until you can `grep` for them.

### Consequences

- `[vibe-trace]` events at the nudge (`NudgeHook`), vibe-set (`VibeCommand`), and music (`server.music`) links, via `logger.info` (never `print`), pinned at a level that always reaches the log.
- Because the vibe/music logic runs **client-side** (the `mic` MCP server and hooks), the trace is written to a **persistent, append-only log file** at a known path under the vox state/log directory — shared by the MCP server and the hook subprocesses via multi-process-safe atomic appends — **not** voxd's `tts.log`. The `grep '[vibe-trace]'` proof recipe in `commands/vibe.md` targets that file. **(Amended 2026-07-16 — see below. The original decision routed the trace to stderr; that was wrong.)**
- Current state (the session vibe and the playing music style) is *also* surfaced through the `status` tool — the trace is the event-trail *proof over time*; `status` is the point-in-time *client-observable state*. Both, per "client-observable, not logs."

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| No observability | The mechanism is unprovable — the operator made "prove whether it works" a core goal for both this feature and auto-vibe. |
| Log only in voxd | The vibe/music orchestration is client-side, not in the daemon; a daemon log would never see it. |
| `status`-only | A point-in-time query cannot prove a *sequence* of events fired across a session — only the trace can show "nudge → vibe-set → re-pool." |
| **Trace to stderr** (originally chosen) | **Wrong — reverted (vox-9po7).** The MCP host discards MCP-server and hook stderr; it is not persisted to any greppable file. A live smoke test on 4.12.2 confirmed `grep '[vibe-trace]'` finds nothing anywhere. "Log to stderr" was functionally "do not log." |

### Amendment — 2026-07-16 (vox-9po7): stderr sink was a mistake; trace goes to a persistent log file

The original Consequences routed `[vibe-trace]` to the MCP-server / hook **stderr**, assuming Claude Code captured it to a greppable log. It does not: the CLI's per-server MCP log holds only client-side "Calling MCP tool" wrapper lines, and the server/hook stderr is discarded. The 4.12.2 live smoke test found the feature itself works end-to-end (the `music_hint` round-trips through the API and the agent re-pools), but the DES-046 proof — a **core** operator goal — was unreachable: no `[vibe-trace]` line existed in any runtime file.

**Correction:** the trace is written to a **persistent, append-only log file** at a known path under the vox state/log directory, shared by both emitters (MCP server + hook subprocesses) via multi-process-safe atomic (`O_APPEND`, single-line) writes. The stderr emission is **deleted** (forward integration, PY-RF-6 — no dual-write). `commands/vibe.md` documents the real file path. The trace format is unchanged; only the sink moved. Root cause of the mistake: the decision assumed the host persisted stderr without verifying it against the running system — the "verify outputs, not just metrics" discipline applied to observability, not just features.

Closes vox-q1z4. Observability sink corrected under vox-9po7.

## DES-047: Fun Is a Feature — Entertainment Is In Scope, Not a "Won't Do"

**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Whether entertainment / personality / fun is a product goal or an excluded non-goal

### Decision

"Fun is a feature" is part of the punt-labs product **spirit** (the org/product ethos, not the ethos identity tool). vox is **partly** entertainment by design — not a purely utilitarian notification tool. The prior framing that walled entertainment off as out-of-scope is **struck**: the `prfaq.tex` "Won't Do: Agent personality voices" feature-appendix item and the matching "Not personality entertainment" FAQ bullet are **deleted** (operator ruling, 2026-07-19).

Two things are the deliberately-fun side of vox:

- **Agent-as-DJ (shipped).** The music panel's DJ-booth personality (DES-044) and the vibe-matched background-music pools are intentional entertainment — the agent plays DJ for you.
- **Codebase-aware podcast + audiobook programs (roadmap).** Upcoming audio-program formats (the DES-041 Program model, Phases 2–3) whose content is drawn from the codebase's own **domain**, the **technology** it uses, or **fiction inspired by** it — so a developer can step back, laugh, and not burn out.

**The "partly" is load-bearing.** The work/notification **voice's mood stays honest signal** — tired after failures is *signal*, not a performed theatrical persona (this is the narrow, still-true part of DES-042, which is **not** reversed). What is reversed is only the *broad* reading that vox avoids entertainment altogether: the DJ layer and the podcast/audiobook programs are in scope.

### Positioning weight

In `prfaq.tex`, fun is a **light-touch** benefit among several — **not** a lede/headline pillar (operator ruling). The top-line positioning stays utility-led (voice+audio layer; eyes-free progress tracking); the DJ line sits in the Solution + Shipped features, and podcast/audiobook sit under "Should Do / Next." Applied at prfaq v2.1 (current doc version v2.2).

### Relationship to DES-042

DES-042 (the mic metaphor; notification-voice mood = signal, not performance) **stands**. This ADR does not license the notification voice to role-play a character. It only removes the blanket "no entertainment" scope exclusion so the DJ + podcast/audiobook fun is admissible.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|------------------|
| Keep "Not personality entertainment" as a Won't Do | Contradicts "fun is a feature" — treated a real product value (entertainment / anti-burnout) as out of scope |
| Rescope the exclusion narrowly instead of deleting it | Operator ruled delete outright; the only narrow truth (notification voice = signal) is already covered by DES-042 |
| Make fun a lede/headline pillar | Operator ruled light-touch — the positioning stays utility-led; fun is one benefit among several |

Relates to vox-iyqq (positioning) and the audio-programs epic (podcast/audiobook = Phases 2–3).

## DES-048: One vox.log — Every Process Appends Directly; the Ship Transport Is Deleted

**Date:** 2026-07-20
**Status:** SETTLED
**Topic:** Log transport for the unified `vox.log` (vox-2594, fixing the vox-fdmm defect)

### Decision

Every process — daemon and every client, including hooks that do **no** daemon work — appends its own records **directly** to one `vox.log` through the multi-writer-safe `O_APPEND` line writer (`AtomicAppendLog`), with rotation guarded by a `flock` shared/exclusive protocol on a stable lock file (DES-013 size-check-then-rename shape, modeled in `docs/vox-2594-log-rotation.tex`, fuzz-clean). The fdmm ship transport (`log_ship.py`, `log_flush.py`, `log_wire.py`, `voxd/log_sink.py`) and `vox-fallback.log` are deleted outright — no fallback file exists. The daemon logs synchronously on its event loop (one uncontended `flock` per record); a thread offload was explicitly ruled out as premature (operator-ratified 2026-07-20).

### Why

fdmm (v4.12.5) routed client records over the WebSocket a client opens *for its actual work*, with an `O_APPEND` "daemon-down" fallback. Two false premises: a no-daemon-work hook opens no WebSocket, and the fallback was not a daemon-down path — it was the *primary* path for the largest client class (skip-path hooks). Live measurement: `vox-fallback.log` 4.2 MB + rotations vs `vox.log` 404 KB. A transport that cannot carry the largest client class cannot deliver "one log." Direct append needs no transport at all: `O_APPEND` single-line writes are already atomic across writers; the only genuinely new safety problem is multi-writer rotation, closed by the `flock` protocol (LOCK_SH held across every `open→write→close`; LOCK_EX + size re-check to rotate — no write to a renamed file, at most one rotator, no lost lines).

### Consequences

- Invariants (tested by name): one `vox.log` for daemon + every client record; no daemon round-trip on any hook's logging hot path (DES-017); rotation safe under concurrent writers; 0600 on active file and backups (cn0p); no fallback/migration/shim; persistent-file observability (DES-046).
- The daemon is no longer the log owner; `voxd/daemon.py` drops the `log` frame route. Client lines are stamped `client.<role>.<module>` for grepping.
- A logging failure degrades to a `sys.__stderr__` note — never a crashed hook.

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| A: no-daemon-work hooks open a brief connection to ship their line | Every fast hook pays a daemon round-trip (violates DES-017) and a daemon-down fallback is still required — the two-file split survives |
| C: clients append to a local spool the daemon drains into `vox.log` | Buys daemon-sole-writer, which `O_APPEND` atomicity already provides, at the cost of a drain loop, spool lifecycle, and event-to-visibility latency |
| Keep the fallback but make the split observable | The split *is* the defect — "one vox.log" was the shipped promise; observing the failure is not fixing it |
| Thread offload for the daemon's synchronous `emit` | Same order of cost as the previous in-loop `RotatingFileHandler`; offload now is speculative complexity — revisit only if live-verify shows loop stalls |

Closes vox-2594. Supersedes the fdmm transport recommendation (`docs/logging-proposal.md` rec 3); design of record: `docs/vox-2594-unified-log.md`.
