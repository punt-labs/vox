# Development Workflow

All work in this repository runs as three nested loops. The outermost loop
owns the backlog: what is worth doing and in what order. The middle loop owns
one pull request: a single shippable, revertible change. The innermost loop
owns one mission: a single delegated piece of work inside that change.

```text
Level 1 — Backlog loop   one iteration = one work batch     (beads)
  Level 2 — PR loop      one iteration = one pull request
    Level 3 — Mission    one iteration = one delegated mission
                         (design, code, test — a do-while)
```

Each level hands work down and receives finished results back. Escalation of
scope only goes up: a mission that uncovers a bigger problem grows its PR; a
PR that uncovers a new line of work files a bead for the backlog loop. Defects
move the other way — anything found while a PR is open is fixed in that PR,
never sent back to the backlog.

The pseudocode at each level gives the control flow; a small Z schema at each
level gives the doorway conditions — what must be true to enter an iteration
and what must be true to leave it. The state those schemas observe:

```text
LoopState
  signals       : ℙ SIGNAL  -- issues, alerts, messages not yet triaged
  open          : ℙ BEAD    -- open beads: the single work funnel
  validated     : ℙ BEAD    -- re-proven against current main
  claimed       : ℙ BEAD    -- the current batch
  closed        : ℙ BEAD    -- beads completed by a merged PR
  activeWorkers : ℙ WORKER  -- sub-agents editing the shared worktree
  testCount     : ℕ         -- tests collected by the suite
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  validated ⊆ open
  claimed   ⊆ validated
  open ∩ closed = ∅         -- a bead is open or closed, never both
```

A bead's lifecycle is a walk through these sets: `open → validated → claimed
→ closed`. Steps that were performed ("the recap was sent") appear as named
predicates over declared terms, never as bare primed flags.

## Roles

The operator owns requirements and design direction, rules on genuine design
forks, and confirms the audio demo by ear. Claude runs everything else: the
backlog, the missions, the review cycles, and the merges. Review of code is
done by agents — the local review agents plus Copilot and Bugbot on the PR.
There is no human review gate. The operator reads code in the IDE, but that
inspection is separate, feeds design discussion only, and nothing in these
loops waits on it.

## Level 1 — The backlog loop

The backlog loop keeps the bead tracker true and decides what to work on
next. Beads are the single funnel: every piece of work, whatever its origin,
is a bead before it is anything else. One iteration selects and completes one
batch of work. The loop runs at session start and again whenever the current
batch is done.

                   # never filed — only genuinely NEW scope arrives here
        if duplicate(signal):  close_at_door(signal, link_existing_bead)
        elif invalid(signal):  close_at_door(signal, stated_reason)
        else:                  bd_create(signal, labels, link_back_to_source)

    # 2. VALIDATE — a bead must be true before it is workable

        confirm nothing merged or decided has superseded it
        confirm it is one rollback-coherent unit (split or merge if not)
        confirm its blocked-by links reflect reality
        otherwise: fix the bead, or close it with the reason

    # 3. ASSESS — automatic ordering; escalate only on a genuine fork
    order = sort(validated, by:

        > broken user journeys             # audio paths users actually hit

        > debt that blocks throughput      # decomposition, OO ratchet paydown
        > features)                        # then features
    if the ordering hits a fork the charter cannot resolve:
        ask the operator for a focus ruling
    else:
        proceed without asking

  ∧ batchRecapSent(claimed) ]
```

### Intake

Work arrives from five places: GitHub issues, Dependabot security alerts,
biff messages from agents in other repositories, requests from the operator,
and new lines of work discovered while building. That last source carries a
boundary: a defect found inside the unit of an open PR is fixed in that PR and
never becomes a bead; only genuinely new scope — discovered outside any open
PR, or clearly a separate rollback unit — enters at intake. At intake, each
signal is either turned into a bead or closed at the door with a stated reason
— duplicate of an existing bead, or invalid.

Security alerts map severity to priority: a critical or high alert becomes a
P1 bead and goes to the front of the order. Security work does not wait.

Intake must not depend on remembering to look. A recurring poll (via the
`/loop` skill) or a session-start sweep checks the GitHub issue list and the
Dependabot alert list, so an alert filed overnight is a bead by the time the
first batch is selected. Start every session with `/loop 2m /biff:read` so
messages from other repos surface too.

### Validation

The codebase moves; beads rot. Before a bead is workable, confirm it is still
real: reproduce the bug or re-check the premise against current main, confirm
no merged PR or design decision has superseded it, confirm it describes one
rollback-coherent unit, and confirm its dependency links are correct. A stale
bead is closed with the reason. A bloated bead is split. Validation covers the
candidates for the coming batch, not the whole backlog every time.

### Assessment

Ordering is automatic in the steady state. The sort is:

1. **Security severity.** Open high or critical alerts outrank everything.
2. **Broken user journeys.** A bug on an audio path users actually hit — a
   provider that will not authenticate, a hook that plays the wrong chime, a
   record that never writes its file — beats new work.
3. **Active epic continuity.** An epic in flight keeps its claim until it is
   done. Interleaving epics is how a backlog churns without shipping.
4. **Debt that blocks throughput.** OO-ratchet paydown, module decomposition,
   test infrastructure that makes the next ten changes cheaper.
5. **Features.** New providers, voices, music, applet surface.

The operator is asked for a focus ruling only when the ordering hits a genuine
fork the rules cannot resolve: two epics competing to be active, a strategic
pivot, or a shift in the debt-versus-feature balance. Direction belongs to the
operator; sequencing inside a settled direction does not require asking.

## Level 2 — The PR loop

One iteration of the PR loop produces one merged pull request. It is entered
when the backlog loop hands down a unit of work sized for throughput, and it
runs the missions (Level 3) needed to build that unit.

### Sizing: throughput, not purity

Nobody reads these diffs. Agents review them, and they squash-merge. So the
size of a PR is an economic decision, not a hygiene one:

- **The floor is transaction cost.** Every PR pays a roughly fixed overhead —
  branch, full-diff review rounds, the audio demo, CI, remote review cycles,
  the merge gate, the recap. A PR too small pays that overhead for too little.
- **The ceiling is reviewer effectiveness.** The reviewers are agents, and
  past a certain diff size their quality drops. A PR too large buys throughput
  at the cost of review quality.
- **The typical right size** is several small beads batched together, or one
  coherent slice of a larger bead. A bead too large to slice into one PR is
  mis-filed: decompose it into an epic whose child beads fit the band.
- **Rollback coherence still binds.** Whatever merges must revert together
  sensibly. That is the one structural constraint. "Purity," "one concern per
  PR," and "keep the diff small" are not criteria — a docs fix, an OO-ratchet
  paydown, or an adjacent bug fix riding along is welcome, and an improvement
  is never held back or split out for tidiness.

### Local review before the PR

Full-diff local review is where issues die cheaply. A local round costs
seconds; a remote review cycle costs minutes to hours. Both `code-reviewer`
and `silent-failure-hunter` run on the full diff — silent-failure-hunter
matters especially in vox, where a swallowed provider error becomes silence
the user cannot diagnose. Every finding is fixed in this PR. A dismissal
requires the exact finding, the specific reason it does not apply, and the
code reference. Opening a PR with unresolved local findings is a procedural
violation.

### The audio demo gate

`make check` passing means the code compiles and the tests pass. It does not
mean the feature works — and for vox it cannot, because vox produces audio
that only a human can judge. Before any PR opens, the feature is driven
through its real entry point — a `mic` tool call, a CLI command, a hook fire —
with the expected outcome written down first, after `make install` and
`vox daemon restart` so the running daemon is the just-built code. Machine
evidence comes from `mic:status`, `vox doctor`, and a grep of `vox.log`. Then
the operator confirms what no introspection API can attest: that the audio
sounded right — clean, the correct voice, the music ducked, the chime fired.
Run the canonical flight in [`docs/testing/manual-tests.md`](testing/manual-tests.md)
and ask after each audible step, immediately, because audio impressions decay
within seconds. This is the one human gate in the loops, and it is a demo, not
a diff.

## Level 3 — The mission loop (design, code, test)

One iteration is one delegated mission: a single piece of design,
implementation, test, or review work executed by a specialist sub-agent under
an ethos mission contract. The next mission does not start until this loop
completes on the current one.

The mission loop is a do-while: the work runs at least once, and the
review-and-fix cycle repeats until a round comes back clean.

```text
function mission_loop(mission):
    contract = write_contract(mission)   # problem, invariants, quality bar,
                                         # commit discipline — never a
                                         # write-set for design work; cite the

                                         # protocol/data work
    dispatch(contract)                   # mission create + background spawn;
                                         # verify the worker is running
    do:
        worker designs / codes / tests   # tests lead; TDD for bug fixes;
                                         # stateful-audio work is model-checked
                                         # BEFORE implementation
        worker commits locally           # each commit passes make check
        result   = worker submits
        findings = evaluator review      # a DISTINCT specialist
                 + leader verification   # make install; vox daemon restart;
                                         # make test on the installed artifact;
                                         # drive the real entry point;
                                         # review agents on the mission diff
        if findings: reflect(findings)   # another round, same mission
    while findings remain
    close(mission)
```

Entry and exit for one mission iteration:

```text

  ∧ activeWorkers = {workerOf(m)}         -- one worker at a time in a shared
                                          --   worktree
  ∧ (statefulAudioClass(m) ⇒ modelChecked(m)) ]  -- z-spec before code

ExitMission ≙ [ Δ LoopState; m : MISSION |
  verdict(m) = accept                     -- from an evaluator ≠ worker
  ∧ findings(m) = ∅                       -- the do-while ran dry
  ∧ (∀ c : commitsOf(m) • checkGreen(c))  -- every commit passed make check
  ∧ testCount′ ≥ testCount                -- coverage never decreases
  ∧ ooRatchetHeld(m)                      -- no metric regressed; ≥ 1 improved
  ∧ missionClosed(m) ]
```

`statefulAudioClass(m)` holds when the mission changes a stateful subsystem
with three or more modes and transitions between them, or an invariant that
must hold across transitions — the music playlist (`off → generating-first →
playing-filling → rotating`), the vibe/signal accumulation, the daemon
playback lifecycle, a concurrent-writer discipline (the `vox.log` rotation
lock). It does NOT hold for pure I/O helpers, provider SDK wrappers, text
normalization, or single-function fixes with no state. When it holds, the
model (`docs/<feature>.tex`) is `fuzz`-clean and, for higher-stakes
invariants, ProB-model-checked, BEFORE the implementation mission dispatches.

### Who does what

The leader runs the workflow; the specialists produce the work. The boundary
is strict in both directions.

**The leader owns the workflow.** The backlog, the mission contract,
dispatch, monitoring, the local review agents (run on each mission's diff and
on the full diff), the audio demo, and every git and GitHub operation:
branches, pushes, opening the PR, driving remote review, resolving threads,
merging, and closing out. The leader does not write production code. The only
files the leader authors directly are the doc set — `CHANGELOG.md`,
`CLAUDE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `README.md`, this `WORKFLOW.md`, design docs, and
plan files — and those still ship through PRs.

**The worker owns the work.** The thinking and the code inside its mission —
the design decisions its contract leaves open, the tests, the implementation,
and local commits on the current branch. A worker never creates branches,
never pushes, never opens PRs, and never touches review threads. Putting
workflow operations into a worker's prompt is a contract defect.

**The evaluator** — always a different specialist from the worker, and never
bound to the same role — reviews the worker's result inside the mission before
the leader accepts it. The pairings live in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Remote review findings are the one delegation that is not a mission.** When
Copilot or Bugbot report on the PR, the leader reads each finding and hands
the mechanical fix to a bare `Agent()`, then pushes and resolves the thread
itself.

### The lifecycle

1. **Contract.** The leader writes the mission contract: the problem, the
   invariants, the quality bar, and the commit discipline — one commit per
   logical step, each passing `make check`, never more than thirty minutes of
   work uncommitted. A design mission's contract never prescribes a write-set;
   the specialist decides what to create, split, or extract. For protocol or
   data work the contract cites the OO rules (`../.claude/rules/python-*.md`)
   with a BEFORE/AFTER example, because sub-agents revert to procedural habits
   when the prompt is not explicit.
2. **Dispatch is two operations.** `ethos mission create` writes the contract;
   a separate `Agent(subagent_type=<worker>, run_in_background=true)` spawn
   starts the worker. Verify the worker is actually running — a contract with
   no agent behind it is orphaned work.
3. **The worker executes.** Tests lead: a bug fix starts from a failing test
   that reproduces the defect, and the fix is done when it passes; a feature
   ships its tests with the code; the test count never goes down. Stateful-
   audio work gets its model-check before implementation. Every commit passes
   `make check` — zero exceptions, zero unauthorized suppressions.
4. **The leader monitors by the filesystem, never by git activity.** A worker
   editing files is working, even with zero commits — analysis and reading are
   invisible. Progress is judged by whether the working tree is changing and
   advancing. An empty commit log is never a reason to intervene, commit by
   proxy, or stop the agent. A genuine stall — no file changes over a long
   window and no response to a status message — is the only cause for taking
   over. Monitoring is silent: concrete facts or action, no narration of the
   wait.
5. **Result and evaluation.** The worker submits its result; a distinct
   evaluator reviews it; reflect-and-advance rounds continue until the
   evaluator accepts.
6. **The leader verifies and closes.** Check the result against the contract:
   `make install`, `vox daemon restart`, `make test` against the installed
   artifact, and exercise the change through its real entry point with the
   expected output written first — one invalid input, one missing/erroring
   dependency, one boundary. Run the applicable local review agents on the
   mission diff and fix every finding; a dismissal requires the exact finding,
   the specific reason it does not apply, and the code reference. If the result
   raises a design question, it goes to the operator as a concrete decision —
   with a recommendation — before any dependent mission dispatches. Then close
   the mission.

## Invariants

1. **Beads are the single funnel.** Every piece of work is a bead before it
   is anything else; external queues (issues, alerts) drain into it at intake.
2. **A satisfied merge gate means merge now.** The gate is the only path to a
   merge, and nothing waits once it passes. Merge is always explicit — never
   `--auto`, never `--admin`.
3. **Findings never wait.** Review feedback is handled the moment it arrives,
   not on the next poll tick and never in a follow-up PR. Threads are resolved
   only against a landed commit, one by one, never in bulk.
4. **Every push restarts the merge gate.** Fresh CI and fresh reviews on the
   new commit, with the single Bugbot exception stated in the gate.
5. **Defects flow inward, scope flows outward.** A defect found while a PR is
   open is fixed in that PR. Only genuinely new lines of work become beads.
6. **The operator gates the audio demo and direction, never diffs or
   sequencing.**
7. **Close-out is inside the loop.** The recap email, branch hygiene, and
   starting the next unit are steps of the loop, not afterthoughts.
8. **No migration, compat, shim, or version-bridge code.** Punt Labs products
   have no installed base to migrate; the leader strikes any such element at
   design review, before it reaches implementation.
9. **The daemon is the audio host.** `voxd` owns playback, the cache, the
   music program, and the recordings on disk; clients are thin controllers.
   Work that touches audio, audio files, or daemon-owned state routes through
   the daemon so it behaves the same whether the daemon is local or remote.
10. **Never touch `vox.md` / `vox.local.md` directly.** The daemon writes
    them; all state is reachable through the `mic` tools. Racing the files
    corrupts state.
