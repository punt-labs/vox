"""Integration test for ``VoxDaemon._lifespan`` -- the background-task wiring.

Fix #4: the lifespan starts three background tasks (playback consumer, the sole
control writer, and the playback loop). This drives the real lifespan context and
asserts (a) all three tasks are announced started and (b) a command posted to the
service is *applied end-to-end* by the running control writer -- the daemon-level
guard against the bas7 (#291) "a transition was never listened to" failure class.
