"""Tests for :class:`InterruptRace` -- the "how did the track stop?" decision.

These port the unit-level ``_exit_code`` assertions that lived on ``ProgramLoop``
before the race machinery was extracted, and cover the four outcomes ``settle``
decides between: a user interrupt wins outright, a clean player exit (code 0) is a
natural end, a *raised* ``wait`` is a player error retrieved and logged so it never
masquerades as a clean advance, and a non-zero exit is a fault (F3).
