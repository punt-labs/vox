"""Behavioral-parity snapshot for the playback loop (ports tests/music/test_loop.py).

Every test drives the REAL loop + the REAL ControlChannel consumer with a fake
player whose process end the test controls. Assertions are on what the loop
actually *spawned* -- a different file on track-end (the auto-advance is a real,
listened-to transition), no advance past a retune's finish, the current player
surviving a retune, the player killed on off/skip -- and on the Program mode,
never on removed scheduler internals.
